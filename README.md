| **[Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09462v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under investigation regarding concerns of potential academic misconduct.

| **[Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09330v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09244v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought; a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous and intelligent behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leading the Follower: Learning Persuasive Agents in Social Deduction Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09087v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses. In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Self-Improving Agents to Learn at Test Time With Human-In-The-Loop Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17131v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS25 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</p></details> |  |
| **[OrcaLoca: An LLM Agent Framework for Software Issue Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00350v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[CommandSans: Securing AI Agents with Surgical Precision Prompt Sanitization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08829v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of LLM agents with access to numerous tools and sensitive data significantly widens the attack surface for indirect prompt injections. Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current defenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate malicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that prevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach inspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not contain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we propose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any instructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious instructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this approach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the context of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with readily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on unrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic origin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across a wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB and SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on AgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3) a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20% relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Under Review for ACL |
| **[CaRT: Teaching LLM Agents to Know When They Know Enough](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08517v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08255v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Simulating Teams with LLM Agents: Interactive 2D Environments for Studying Human-AI Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08242v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling users to create their own simulations offers a powerful way to study team dynamics and performance. We introduce VirTLab, a system that allows researchers and practitioners to design interactive, customizable simulations of team dynamics with LLM-based agents situated in 2D spatial environments. Unlike prior frameworks that restrict scenarios to predefined or static tasks, our approach enables users to build scenarios, assign roles, and observe how agents coordinate, move, and adapt over time. By bridging team cognition behaviors with scalable agent-based modeling, our system provides a testbed for investigating how environments influence coordination, collaboration, and emergent team behaviors. We demonstrate its utility by aligning simulated outcomes with empirical evaluations and a user study, underscoring the importance of customizable environments for advancing research on multi-agent simulations. This work contributes to making simulations accessible to both technical and non-technical users, supporting the design, execution, and analysis of complex multi-agent experiments.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08191v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoQual: An LLM Agent for Automated Discovery of Interpretable Features for Review Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08081v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Learning on the Job: An Experience-Driven Self-Evolving Agent for Long-Horizon Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08002v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoAgent: A Fully-Automated and Zero-Code Framework for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent</p></details> |
| **[Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07841v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice, gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and (iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Generation of Multi-LLM Agents Communication Topologies with Graph Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07799v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Applications: Current Paradigms and the Next Frontier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04596v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to four major application paradigms: LLM app stores, LLM agents, self-hosted LLM services, and LLM-powered devices. Each has its advantages but also shares common challenges. LLM app stores lower the barrier to development but lead to platform lock-in; LLM agents provide autonomy but lack a unified communication mechanism; self-hosted LLM services enhance control but increase deployment complexity; and LLM-powered devices improve privacy and real-time performance but are limited by hardware. This paper reviews and analyzes these paradigms, covering architecture design, application ecosystem, research progress, as well as the challenges and open problems they face. Based on this, we outline the next frontier of LLM applications, characterizing them through three interconnected layers: infrastructure, protocol, and application. We describe their responsibilities and roles of each layer and demonstrate how to mitigate existing fragmentation limitations and improve security and scalability. Finally, we discuss key future challenges, identify opportunities such as protocol-driven cross-platform collaboration and device integration, and propose a research roadmap for openness, security, and sustainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09685v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music.

| **[Can LLM Agents Simulate Multi-Turn Human Behavior? Evidence from Real Online Customer Behavior Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20749v7)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research shows that LLM Agents can generate ``believable'' human behaviors via prompt-only methods, and such agents have been increasingly adopted in downstream applications. However, existing evaluation of these agents only focuses on qualitative believability (whether human raters think they are accurate), leaving open questions of whether LLM agents can accurately generate step-by-step actions mimicking a particular human's behavior in a multi-turn interaction task. In this work, we take shopping as a case study and present the first large-scale quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to accurately simulate human behavior. Using real-world data from 31,865 online shopping sessions containing 230,965 user actions, our evaluation reveals that prompt-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, Llama, Claude) achieve only 11.86% accuracy in generating human actions, highlighting a substantial gap in actual behavioral accuracy. Through experiments, we also showcase that strategies as simple as fine-tuning LLMs on real human click-through data augmented with synthesized reasoning traces can greatly enhance models' performance. The fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves 17.26% action generation accuracy and 33.86% F1 score on final purchase prediction, representing substantial improvements of 5.4% and 13.85% over prompt-only baselines. This work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for human behavior simulation and provides actionable insights for developing more accurate LLM agents for future downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customer-R1: Personalized Simulation of Human Behaviors via RL-based LLM Agent in Online Shopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07230v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[NewtonBench: Benchmarking Generalizable Scientific Law Discovery in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07172v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Optimization Across Multiple Agents for Representing Diverse Human Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07064v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population. Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMPASS: A Multi-Turn Benchmark for Tool-Mediated Planning & Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07043v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences. To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation, accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms. Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical, user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging theoretical advances with real-world impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongRM: Revealing and Unlocking the Context Boundary of Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06915v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM) with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.</p></details> |  |
| **[SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06843v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[PARSE: LLM Driven Schema Optimization for Reliable Entity Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08623v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7% improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the first retry and and maintaining practical latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Scaling LLM Multi-turn RL with End-to-end Summarization-based Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06727v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

We present WebDART, a general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores. WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks: navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena, WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.</p></details> |  |

When the 'agents' are large language models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them.

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings), Project Page: https://kaist-dmlab.github.io/MONAQ</p></details> |
| **[Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on expensive human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a paper presented at the \textit{European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)}.

| **[Constraint-Aware Route Recommendation from Natural Language via Hierarchical LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06078v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries. Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about pop-up banner closure. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Time Series Classification via In-Context Reasoning with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05950v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation.

| **[LLM-FS-Agent: A Deliberative Role-based Large Language Model Architecture for Transparent Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05935v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning, often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role, enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p = 0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency, establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[BenchAgents: Multi-Agent Systems for Structured Benchmark Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22584v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation insights are limited by the availability of high-quality benchmarks. As models evolve, there is a need to create benchmarks that can measure progress on new and complex generative capabilities. However, manually creating new benchmarks is slow and expensive, restricting comprehensive evaluations for any capability. We introduce BenchAgents, a multi-agent framework that methodically leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate evaluation benchmark creation while inherently ensuring data and (evaluation) metric quality. BenchAgents decomposes the benchmark creation process into planning, generation, verification, and evaluation, each of which is ] orchestrated via LLM agents. These agents interact with each other and utilize feedback from benchmark developers to improve and flexibly control data diversity and quality. We use BenchAgents to create benchmarks to evaluate capabilities related to planning, constraint satisfaction, and causal reasoning spanning both language and vision modalities. We then use these benchmarks to study state-of-the-art models and extract new insights into common failure modes and model differences.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoPentester: An LLM Agent-based Framework for Automated Pentesting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05605v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry practices for safeguarding computer systems. As cyber threats grow in scale and complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of human professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the pentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct pentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework, AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP, AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security tools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human pentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT. Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to PentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews, which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TrustCom 2025 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[AgentDR Dynamic Recommendation with Implicit Item-Item Relations via LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05598v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04365v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at AutoML 2025 (Methods Track); to be published in proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Agent Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05442v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents have opened new possibilities for human-AI collaboration, offering powerful tools to navigate this complex research landscape. In this paper, we introduce SciSciGPT, an open-source, prototype AI collaborator that uses the science of science as a testbed to explore the potential of LLM-powered research tools. SciSciGPT automates complex workflows, supports diverse analytical approaches, accelerates research prototyping and iteration, and facilitates reproducibility. Through case studies, we demonstrate its ability to streamline a wide range of empirical and analytical research tasks while highlighting its broader potential to advance research. We further propose an LLM Agent capability maturity model for human-AI collaboration, envisioning a roadmap to further improve and expand upon frameworks like SciSciGPT. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, frameworks like SciSciGPT may play increasingly pivotal roles in scientific research and discovery, unlocking further opportunities. At the same time, these new advances also raise critical challenges, from ensuring transparency and ethical use to balancing human and AI contributions. Addressing these issues may shape the future of scientific inquiry and inform how we train the next generation of scientists to thrive in an increasingly AI-integrated research ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Is a Hammer and LLMs Are Nails: A Simple Reinforcement Learning Recipe for Strong Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04885v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection poses a serious threat to the reliability and safety of LLM agents. Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

| **[Alignment Tipping Process: How Self-Evolution Pushes LLM Agents Off the Rails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04860v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Outcome Reward: Decoupling Search and Answering Improves LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04695v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality, including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation. Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards, underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.</p></details> |  |

In this study we introduce a deterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy adherence in agentic workflows. Our method operates in two phases: (1) an offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 (industry track), 12 pages</p></details> |

In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH ASIA 2025 (Conference Track); Project page: https://pku-mocca.github.io/Social-Agent-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-and-Play Dramaturge: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Iterative Narrative Script Refinement via Collaborative LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05188v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives. How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the generated scripts.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Agent's autonomy introduces both risks and opportunities, yet its effects remain unclear. To better understand this, we conducted a 3$\times$3 between-subjects experiment ($N=450$) to study how agent's autonomy level and personalization influence users' privacy concerns, trust and willingness to use, as well as the underlying psychological processes. We find that personalization without considering users' privacy preferences increases privacy concerns and decreases trust and willingness to use. Autonomy moderates these effects: Intermediate autonomy flattens the impact of personalization compared to No- and Full autonomy conditions. Our results suggest that rather than aiming for perfect model alignment in output generation, balancing autonomy of agent's action and user control offers a promising path to mitigate the personalization-privacy dilemma.</p></details> |  |

While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

These strategies are impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories, extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference, a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++, WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PNAS Nexus</p></details> |

However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL, trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents. Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constructing coherent spatial memory in LLM agents through graph rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04195v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a map description through global traversal navigation instructions (e.g., visiting each room sequentially with action signals such as north, west, etc.), an LLM can often infer the implicit spatial layout of the environment and answer user queries by providing a shortest path from a start to a destination (for instance, navigating from the lobby to a meeting room via the hall and elevator). However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective, history-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Agent Collaboration for C to Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03879v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating C to memory-safe languages, like Rust, prevents critical memory safety vulnerabilities that are prevalent in legacy C software. Existing approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not generalize on larger (> 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR (Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command line utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 485 lines of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention. To our knowledge, it is the first such system that reliably translates C programs of this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by up to 18.9% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Conceptual Knowledge to Locate Software Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21427v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue localization, which identifies faulty code elements such as files or functions, is critical for effective bug fixing. While recent LLM-based and LLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale repositories due to concern tangling, where relevant logic is buried in large functions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across files. To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that abstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens decomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level concerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It operates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual knowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that retrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and integrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt enhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks derived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art tools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains of over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level localization. It generalizes across models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1) with Hit@1 and Recall@10 gains up to 504% and 376%, respectively. Ablation studies and manual evaluation confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the constructed concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoMosaic-Bench: Evaluating Multi-Source Information Seeking in Tool-Augmented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02271v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However, existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration), InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still struggle with even basic tool handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFCAudit: An LLM Agent for Functional Bug Detection in Network Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00714v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional correctness is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of network protocol implementations. Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCAudit, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCAudit comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCAudit across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCAudit identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |

Thus, there is an urgent need to quantitatively \textit{evaluate LLMs as agents} on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional benchmark that consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities. Our extensive test over \num API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and many OSS competitors that are no larger than 70B. We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents. Improving instruction following and training on high quality multi-round alignment data could improve agent performance. And different from existing assumptions, training on code present ambivalent impacts on different agent tasks. Datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[LLM Agents for Automated Dependency Upgrades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03480v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a codebase expands over time, its library dependencies can become outdated and require updates to maintain innovation and security. However, updating a library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner. The system architecture consists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent, Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALMAS: an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03463v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been leading the way in applied LLM research across a number of fields. One notable area is software development, where researchers have advanced the automation of code implementation, code testing, code maintenance, inter alia, using LLM agents. However, software development is a multifaceted environment that extends beyond just code. As such, a successful LLM system must factor in multiple stages of the software development life-cycle (SDLC). In this paper, we propose a vision for ALMAS, an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework, which follows the above SDLC philosophy such that it may work within an agile software development team to perform several tasks end-to-end. ALMAS aligns its agents with agile roles, and can be used in a modular fashion to seamlessly integrate with human developers and their development environment. We showcase the progress towards ALMAS through our published works and a use case demonstrating the framework, where ALMAS is able to seamlessly generate an application and add a new feature.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods -- whether sparse or dense -- often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 26K expert-annotated examples on S&P-500 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, current systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents AudioToolAgent, a framework that coordinates audio-language models as tools via a central LLM agent that accesses tool adapters for audio question answering and speech-to-text. The agent selects tools, asks follow-up questions, and compares outputs for verification. Experiments with MMAU, MMAR, and MMAU-Pro show state-of-the-art accuracy: up to 74.10% on MMAU, 68.80% on MMAR, and 57.96% on MMAU-Pro. Monte Carlo sampling for shapley values across 374 configurations identifies effective agent-tool combinations. The modular design allows integration of new tools and eliminates the use of data and training costs.

Inspired by how human data scientists work in computational notebooks, DatawiseAgent introduces a unified interaction representation and a multi-stage architecture based on finite-state transducers (FSTs). This design enables flexible long-horizon planning, progressive solution development, and robust recovery from execution failures. Extensive experiments across diverse data science scenarios and models show that DatawiseAgent consistently achieves SOTA performance by surpassing strong baselines such as AutoGen and TaskWeaver, demonstrating superior effectiveness and adaptability. Further evaluations reveal graceful performance degradation under weaker or smaller models, underscoring the robustness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The camera-ready version for EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, Under review at Financial Innovation (FIN)</p></details> |

These agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.</p></details> | 22 pages |

We introduce Gala, a framework that addresses this challenge with a global agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentCaster: Reasoning-Guided Tornado Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03349v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex, high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging, long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of 3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of 12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning tasks in critical domains.</p></details> |  |

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentations ADAPT Annual Scientific Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |

There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01379v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p></details> |  |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection, leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0), single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii) attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability, moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27% run end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~ 100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly deployable attack code. Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps. Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps. These findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step reasoning and tool use.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Social Welfare Function Leaderboard: When LLM Agents Allocate Social Welfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01164v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.</p></details> |  |

| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical Exams -- Dataset Construction and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11517v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 12 pages,3 figures |
| **[End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$).

Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios.

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |
| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks.

Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks.

Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field.

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1).

| **[Towards Training A Chinese Large Language Model for Anesthesiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02742v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their significant practical utility. However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce MedBench, a comprehensive benchmark for the Chinese medical domain, comprising 40,041 questions sourced from authentic examination exercises and medical reports of diverse branches of medicine. In particular, this benchmark is composed of four key components: the Chinese Medical Licensing Examination, the Resident Standardization Training Examination, the Doctor In-Charge Qualification Examination, and real-world clinic cases encompassing examinations, diagnoses, and treatments. MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge. These findings elucidate both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs within the context of MedBench, with the ultimate goal of aiding the medical research community.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI-24 |

As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a visual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep pace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual analytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into various UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles, performing sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on piles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the tool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts that used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HICSS 2026. 10 pages, 4 figures.

Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.

The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Industrial Track)</p></details> |
| **[Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09599v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/PTTS</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection approaches primarily rely on moderation classifiers, which require significant computation overhead for training and are limited to predefined taxonomies. In this work, we explore data attribution approaches that measure the similarity between individual training samples and a small set of unsafe target examples, based on data representations such as hidden states or gradients. We identify a key limitation in existing methods: unsafe target texts contain both critical tokens that make them unsafe and neutral tokens (e.g., stop words or benign facts) that are necessary to form fluent language, and the latter of which makes the overall representations ``noisy'' for the purpose of detecting unsafe training data. To address this challenge, we propose Denoised Representation Attribution (DRA), a novel representation-based data attribution approach that denoises training and target representations for unsafe data detection. Across tasks of filtering jailbreaks and detecting gender bias, the proposed approach leads to significant improvement for data attribution methods, outperforming SOTA methods that are mostly based on moderation classifiers.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines. Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability, then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on both sparse and dense retrieval.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NLPCC 2025 (Springer), to appear November 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Surface Reasoning: Unveiling the True Long Chain-of-Thought Capacity of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09544v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet designing smooth, safe choreographies remains a complex task requiring expert knowledge. We present SwarmGPT, a language-based choreographer that leverages the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline drone performance design. The LLM is augmented by a safety filter that ensures deployability by making minimal corrections when safety or feasibility constraints are violated. By decoupling high-level choreographic design from low-level motion planning, our system enables non-experts to iteratively refine choreographies using natural language without worrying about collisions or actuator limits. We validate our approach through simulations with swarms up to 200 drones and real-world experiments with up to 20 drones performing choreographies to diverse types of songs, demonstrating scalable, synchronized, and safe performances. Beyond entertainment, this work offers a blueprint for integrating foundation models into safety-critical swarm robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RA-L 2025</p></details> |

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.</p></details> |  |

Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models Against Multilingual Typographical Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09536v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual, real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly available.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Can We Reliably Rank Model Performance across Domains without Labeled Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09519v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets, spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings: ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + references and Appendix</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models.

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).

Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025 Main)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety. We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flattery in Motion: Benchmarking and Analyzing Sycophancy in Video-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07180v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations.

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

| **[Domain-Adapted Pre-trained Language Models for Implicit Information Extraction in Crash Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09434v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.</p></details> |  |

This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory. Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple, practical recipes for robust training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[On the Representations of Entities in Auto-regressive Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09421v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM for the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08604v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation, models recommend items based on user's interaction history. To this end, current models usually incorporate information such as item descriptions and user intent or preferences. User preferences are usually not explicitly given in open-source datasets, and thus need to be approximated, for example via large language models (LLMs). Current approaches leverage approximated user preferences only during training and rely solely on the past interaction history for recommendations, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt to changing preferences, potentially reinforcing echo chambers. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, namely preference discerning, which explicitly conditions a generative recommendation model on user preferences in natural language within its context. To evaluate preference discerning, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. Upon evaluating current state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, we discover that their ability to dynamically adapt to evolving user preferences is limited. To address this, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{D}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in our benchmark. Our results show that Mender effectively adapts its recommendation guided by human preferences, even if not observed during training, paving the way toward more flexible recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR, Code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/preference_discerning</p></details> |
| **[Confidence-weighted integration of human and machine judgments for superior decision-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08083v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can surpass humans in certain forecasting tasks. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Systems in Radiology: Design, Applications, Evaluation, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09404v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChoirRec: Semantic User Grouping via LLMs for Conversion Rate Prediction of Low-Activity Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09393v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems. Existing approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users. To address these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users. With a dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer, ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform. ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.</p></details> |  |

Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code link: https://github.com/cokeshao/HoliTom</p></details> |

However, GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Exploration of Physics Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</p></details> |  |

A Reasoning Benchmark on Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09361v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances (14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR October 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of 47\% even at 90\% recall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Mechanistic Explanation of Deductive Reasoning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09340v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the logical inference required by the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cell2Text: Multimodal LLM for Generating Single-Cell Descriptions from RNA-Seq Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24840v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.</p></details> |  |

Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09330v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Language Models See Better When They Look Shallower](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21447v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically extract visual features from the final layers of a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |

With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask Tokens as Prophet: Fine-Grained Cache Eviction for Efficient dLLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09309v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/jianuo-huang/MaskKV</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[CapGeo: A Caption-Assisted Approach to Geometric Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09302v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.</p></details> |  |

Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data.

In this work, we systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and \textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the \underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.</p></details> |  |

Compared to Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), Mamba achieves linear computation complexity with the sequence length and demonstrates superior performance. However, Mamba is hard to accelerate due to the scattered activation outliers and the complex computation dependency, rendering existing LLM accelerators inefficient. In this paper, we propose LightMamba that co-designs the quantization algorithm and FPGA accelerator architecture for efficient Mamba inference. We first propose an FPGA-friendly post-training quantization algorithm that features rotation-assisted quantization and power-of-two SSM quantization to reduce the majority of computation to 4-bit. We further design an FPGA accelerator that partially unrolls the Mamba computation to balance the efficiency and hardware costs. Through computation reordering as well as fine-grained tiling and fusion, the hardware utilization and memory efficiency of the accelerator get drastically improved. We implement LightMamba on Xilinx Versal VCK190 FPGA and achieve 4.65x to 6.06x higher energy efficiency over the GPU baseline. When evaluated on Alveo U280 FPGA, LightMamba reaches 93 tokens/s, which is 1.43x that of the GPU baseline.

Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09275v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs</p></details> |  |

This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.</p></details> |  |

AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/LLM4CardGame</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought; a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous and intelligent behavior.</p></details> |  |

In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.</p></details> |  |

Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities.

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 2025</p></details> |

Using newly available open-source LLMs, OLMo and BLOOM, which provide access to their pre-training corpora, we investigate how LLMs address causal discovery through three research questions. We examine: (i) the impact of memorization for accurate causal relation prediction, (ii) the influence of incorrect causal relations in pre-training data, and (iii) the contextual nuances that influence LLMs' understanding of causal relations. Our findings indicate that while LLMs are effective in recognizing causal relations that occur frequently in pre-training data, their ability to generalize to new or rare causal relations is limited. Moreover, the presence of incorrect causal relations significantly undermines the confidence of LLMs in corresponding correct causal relations, and the contextual information critically affects the outcomes of LLMs to discern causal connections between random variables.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[System Prompt Optimization with Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09666v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics.

| **[Understanding and Improving Information Preservation in Prompt Compression for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19114v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their successful application to a broad range of tasks. However, in information-intensive tasks, the prompt length can grow fast, leading to increased computational requirements, performance degradation, and induced biases from irrelevant or redundant information. Recently, various prompt compression techniques have been introduced to optimize the trade-off between reducing input length and retaining performance. We propose a holistic evaluation framework that allows for in-depth analysis of prompt compression methods. We focus on three key aspects, besides compression ratio: (i) downstream task performance, (ii) grounding in the input context, and (iii) information preservation. Using our framework, we analyze state-of-the-art soft and hard compression methods and show that some fail to preserve key details from the original prompt, limiting performance on complex tasks. By identifying these limitations, we are able to improve one soft prompting method by controlling compression granularity, achieving up to +23% in downstream performance, +8 BERTScore points in grounding, and 2.7x more entities preserved in compression. Ultimately, we find that the best effectiveness/compression rate trade-off is achieved with soft prompting combined with sequence-level training.The code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/information-preservation-in-prompt-compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Findings), 22 pages, 6 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |
| **[DICE: Structured Reasoning in LLMs through SLM-Guided Chain-of-Thought Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09211v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning Paradigm for Generalizable and Stability-Optimized Car-Following Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14241v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Car-following models (CFMs) are fundamental to traffic flow analysis and autonomous driving. Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven CFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets limits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in real-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral fidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string stability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the generalization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a lightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract fundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this knowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally efficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates stability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the resulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the local and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment. We evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its performance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs. Both empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior behavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and scalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

This study explored diverse learner profiles within a multi-agent, LLM-empowered learning environment. Data was collected from 312 undergraduate students at a university in China as they participated in a six-module course. Based on hierarchical cluster analyses of system profiles and student-AI interactive dialogues, we found that students exhibit varied behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement tendencies. This analysis allowed us to identify two types of dropouts (early dropouts and stagnating interactors) and three completer profiles (active questioners, responsive navigators, and lurkers). The results showed that high levels of interaction do not always equate to productive learning and vice versa. Prior knowledge significantly influenced interaction patterns and short-term learning benefits. Further analysis of the human-AI dialogues revealed that some students actively engaged in knowledge construction, while others displayed a high frequency of regulatory behaviors. Notably, both groups of students achieved comparable learning gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent learning environment in supporting personalized learning. These results underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of engagement in human-AI collaborative learning and provide practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures; Reported on ECER 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving 15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili. Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement, significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range of languages.

Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Since such interventions may carry irreversible effects, it is critical to anticipate not only potential benefits but also possible harms. This study proposes a student development agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate how students with diverse characteristics may evolve under different educational settings without administering them to real students. By validating the approach through a case study on a multi-agent learning environment (MAIC), we demonstrate that the agent's predictions align with real student outcomes in non-cognitive developments. The results suggest that LLM-based simulations hold promise for evaluating AIED innovations efficiently and ethically. Future directions include enhancing profile structures, incorporating fine-tuned or small task-specific models, validating effects of empirical findings, interpreting simulated data and optimizing evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Video Depth Anything: Temporally-Consistent Depth Prediction with Low Memory Consumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09182v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, the effective utilization of multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts, generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5% increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00047v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a triple-branch design comprising Patching, Selecting, and Global modules, to encode the input time-series into patch-wise representations, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints of TriP-LLM are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version of the paper published in IEEE Access (2025).

These LLMs are increasingly proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings, considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logits Replay + MoClip: Stabilized, Low-Cost Post-Training with Minimal Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09152v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training: improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation. However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting. We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level. In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over 40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fewer Weights, More Problems: A Practical Attack on LLM Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07985v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

| **[Aegis: Automated Error Generation and Attribution for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model based multi-agent systems (MAS) have unlocked significant advancements in tackling complex problems, but their increasing capability introduces a structural fragility that makes them difficult to debug. A key obstacle to improving their reliability is the severe scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for error attribution, as existing resources rely on costly and unscalable manual annotation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Aegis, a novel framework for Automated error generation and attribution for multi-agent systems. Aegis constructs a large dataset of 9,533 trajectories with annotated faulty agents and error modes, covering diverse MAS architectures and task domains. This is achieved using a LLM-based manipulator that can adaptively inject context-aware errors into successful execution trajectories. Leveraging fine-grained labels and the structured arrangement of positive-negative sample pairs, Aegis supports three different learning paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. We develop learning methods for each paradigm. Comprehensive experiments show that trained models consistently achieve substantial improvements in error attribution. Notably, several of our fine-tuned LLMs demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary models an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.</p></details> |  |

At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. Therefore, we design a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instructions at each step based on the expected impact of each instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG, highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG, when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire the development of next-generation RAG systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, storing momentum typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from 60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$ GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond I'm Sorry, I Can't: Dissecting Large Language Model Refusal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09708v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by manipulating the interpretable latent space.</p></details> |  |

The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate long-standing threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference article</p></details> |
| **[Leading the Follower: Learning Persuasive Agents in Social Deduction Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09087v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses. In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that \ourname{} consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WWW 2026.

| **[AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20318v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based injection positions, limiting their applicability. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each segment. Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early, practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

To effectively handle diverse customer inquiries, augmenting the knowledge base with "similar questions" that retain semantic meaning while incorporating varied expressions is a cost-effective strategy. In this paper, we introduce the Similar Question Generation (SQG) task for LLM training and inference, proposing context-aware approaches to enable comprehensive semantic exploration and enhanced alignment with source question-answer relationships. We formulate optimization techniques for constructing in-context prompts and selecting an optimal subset of similar questions to expand chatbot knowledge under budget constraints. Both quantitative and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of these methods, achieving a 92% user satisfaction rate in a deployed chatbot system, reflecting an 18% improvement over the unaugmented baseline. These findings highlight the practical benefits of SQG and emphasize the potential of LLMs, not as direct chatbot interfaces, but in supporting non-generative systems for hallucination-free, compliance-guaranteed applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60% compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedLA: A Logic-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23725v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedCritical: Enhancing Medical Reasoning in Small Language Models via Self-Collaborative Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23368v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings |
| **[Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.</p></details> | 51 pages, 27 figures |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process, limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge. In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$ constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to explore the boundaries of our framework.

Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12140v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking GPT-5 for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning in Radiology and Radiation Oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13192v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02669v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d</p></details> |

The challenge focuses on developing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models that answer clinically relevant questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing interpretable justifications aligned with medical reasoning. It introduces two subtasks: (1) answering diverse types of visual questions using the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, and (2) generating multimodal explanations to support clinical decision-making. The Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, created from 6,500 images and 159,549 complex question-answer (QA) pairs, serves as the benchmark for the challenge. By combining quantitative performance metrics and expert-reviewed explainability assessments, this task aims to advance trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis.

| **[MedAtlas: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Round, Multi-Task Medical Reasoning Across Diverse Imaging Modalities and Clinical Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10947v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.26% and +26.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</p></details> | Corrected some typos |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables(2 in main, 4 in appendix)</p></details> |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCoT: Communication-Efficient Federated Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10020v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover, existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01450v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mihara-bot/DIQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Automating Expert-Level Medical Reasoning Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07988v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications.

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/keke-nice/MedTVT-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o.

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark: https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 datasets&benchmarks track submission</p></details> |

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy.

| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical reasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its reasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes decision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical support. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new evaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical reasoning models.

However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |

This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |

Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy.

| **[MedAdapter: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation of Large Language Models towards Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03000v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their improved capabilities in generation and reasoning, adapting large language models (LLMs) to the biomedical domain remains challenging due to their immense size and corporate privacy. In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Vision-Language and Large Language Model Performance in Gastroenterology: GPT, Claude, Llama, Phi, Mistral, Gemma, and Quantized Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00084v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Aims: This study evaluates the medical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in gastroenterology. Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

| **[Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |
| **[MedAgents: Large Language Models as Collaborators for Zero-shot Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10537v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance. Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, Under Review</p></details> |
| **[From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01040v3)** | 2024-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05410v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |

For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases.

| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
