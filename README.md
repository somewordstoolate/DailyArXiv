We introduce Epitome (www.epitome-ai.com), an open experimental platform that operationalizes this paradigm through Matrix-like social worlds where researchers can study isolated human subjects and groups interacting with LLM agents. This maintains ecological validity while enabling precise manipulation of social dynamics. Epitome approaches three frontiers: (1) methodological innovation using LLM confederates to reduce complexity while scaling interactions; (2) empirical investigation of human behavior in AI-saturated environments; and (3) exploration of emergent properties in hybrid collectives. Drawing on interdisciplinary foundations from management, communication, sociology, psychology, and ethics, the platform's modular architecture spans foundation model deployment through data collection. We validate Epitome through replication of three seminal experiments, demonstrating capacity to generate robust findings while reducing experimental complexity. This tool provides crucial insights for understanding how humans navigate AI-mediated social realities, knowledge essential for policy, education, and human-centered AI design.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6figures |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures |
| **[DAO-Agent: Zero Knowledge-Verified Incentives for Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20973v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[One Tool Is Enough: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20957v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[ART: Adaptive Response Tuning Framework -- A Multi-Agent Tournament-Based Approach to LLM Response Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00617v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R^2 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[MolAct: An Agentic RL Framework for Molecular Editing and Property Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20135v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20884v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAR:Multi-Agent Reflexion Improves Reasoning Abilities in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20845v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect, Explain, Escalate: Sustainable Dialogue Breakdown Management for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial capabilities in conversational AI applications, yet their susceptibility to dialogue breakdowns poses significant challenges to deployment reliability and user trust. This paper introduces a "Detect, Explain, Escalate" framework to manage dialogue breakdowns in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing resource-efficient operation. Our approach integrates two key strategies: (1) We fine-tune a compact 8B-parameter model, augmented with teacher-generated reasoning traces, which serves as an efficient real-time breakdown detector and explainer. This model demonstrates robust classification and calibration on English and Japanese dialogues, and generalizes to the BETOLD dataset, improving accuracy by 7% over its baseline. (2) We systematically evaluate frontier LLMs using advanced prompting (few-shot, chain-of-thought, analogical reasoning) for high-fidelity breakdown assessment. These are integrated into an "escalation" architecture where our efficient detector defers to larger models only when necessary, substantially reducing operational costs and computational overhead. Our fine-tuned model and prompting strategies achieve state-of-the-art performance on DBDC5 and strong results on BETOLD, outperforming specialized classifiers on DBDC5 and narrowing the performance gap to larger proprietary models. The proposed monitor-escalate pipeline reduces inference costs by 54%, providing a cost-effective and interpretable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains. Code and models will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning for Multimodal Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping. We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop. Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.</p></details> | 37 pages, 42 figures |
| **[Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC): A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Safe Agentic AI in 5G Autonomous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20275v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[MemR$^3$: Memory Retrieval via Reflective Reasoning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20237v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem. To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBEL: LLM Agents Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20111v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671v4)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game, a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming: Sociological Methodology; USPTO patent pending</p></details> |
| **[GenEnv: Difficulty-Aligned Co-Evolution Between LLM Agents and Environment Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19682v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training capable Large Language Model (LLM) agents is critically bottlenecked by the high cost and static nature of real-world interaction data. We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative environment simulator. Unlike traditional methods that evolve models on static datasets, GenEnv instantiates a dataevolving: the simulator acts as a dynamic curriculum policy, continuously generating tasks specifically tailored to the agent's ``zone of proximal development''. This process is guided by a simple but effective $α$-Curriculum Reward, which aligns task difficulty with the agent's current capabilities. We evaluate GenEnv on five benchmarks, including API-Bank, ALFWorld, BFCL, Bamboogle, and TravelPlanner. Across these tasks, GenEnv improves agent performance by up to \textbf{+40.3\%} over 7B baselines and matches or exceeds the average performance of larger models. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro-based offline data augmentation, GenEnv achieves better performance while using 3.3$\times$ less data. By shifting from static supervision to adaptive simulation, GenEnv provides a data-efficient pathway for scaling agent capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes are available at https://github.com/Gen-Verse/GenEnv</p></details> |
| **[GraphTracer: Graph-Guided Failure Tracing in LLM Agents for Robust Multi-Turn Deep Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10581v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for multi-agent system debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fundamental error in the methodology that affects the validity of the main results</p></details> |
| **[Love, Lies, and Language Models: Investigating AI's Role in Romance-Baiting Scams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16280v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Romance-baiting scams have become a major source of financial and emotional harm worldwide. These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation. We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Declarative Language for Building And Orchestrating LLM-Powered Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19769v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building deployment-ready LLM agents requires complex orchestration of tools, data sources, and control flow logic, yet existing systems tightly couple agent logic to specific programming languages and deployment models. We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises). Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison. We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead. We show that complex workflows involving product search, personalization, and cart management can be expressed in under 50 lines of DSL compared to 500+ lines of imperative code.</p></details> |  |
| **[DREAM: Dynamic Red-teaming across Environments for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19016v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic systems, where their interactions with diverse tools and environments create complex, multi-stage safety challenges. However, existing benchmarks mostly rely on static, single-turn assessments that miss vulnerabilities from adaptive, long-chain attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce DREAM, a framework for systematic evaluation of LLM agents against dynamic, multi-stage attacks. At its core, DREAM uses a Cross-Environment Adversarial Knowledge Graph (CE-AKG) to maintain stateful, cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities. This graph guides a Contextualized Guided Policy Search (C-GPS) algorithm that dynamically constructs attack chains from a knowledge base of 1,986 atomic actions across 349 distinct digital environments. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLM agents reveals a critical vulnerability: these attack chains succeed in over 70% of cases for most models, showing the power of stateful, cross-environment exploits. Through analysis of these failures, we identify two key weaknesses in current agents: contextual fragility, where safety behaviors fail to transfer across environments, and an inability to track long-term malicious intent. Our findings also show that traditional safety measures, such as initial defense prompts, are largely ineffective against attacks that build context over multiple interactions. To advance agent safety research, we release DREAM as a tool for evaluating vulnerabilities and developing more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

MACLA extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability via Bayesian posteriors, selects actions through expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures. Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 percent average performance, outperforming all baselines. On ALFWorld unseen tasks, MACLA reaches 90.3 percent with 3.1 percent positive generalization. The system constructs memory in 56 seconds, 2800 times faster than the state-of-the-art LLM parameter-training baseline, compressing 2851 trajectories into 187 procedures.

| **[Toward Training Superintelligent Software Agents through Self-Play SWE-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18552v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current software agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning (RL) can boost programmer productivity, their training data (e.g., GitHub issues and pull requests) and environments (e.g., pass-to-pass and fail-to-pass tests) heavily depend on human knowledge or curation, posing a fundamental barrier to superintelligence. In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, their capability to rigorously reason about and prove code correctness remains in question. This paper offers a comprehensive study of LLMs' capability to develop correctness proofs for system software written in Rust. We curate a new system-verification benchmark suite, VeruSAGE-Bench, which consists of 849 proof tasks extracted from eight open-source Verus-verified Rust systems. Furthermore, we design different agent systems to match the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs (o4-mini, GPT-5, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 4.5). Our study shows that different tools and agent settings are needed to stimulate the system-verification capability of different types of LLMs. The best LLM-agent combination in our study completes over 80% of system-verification tasks in VeruSAGE-Bench. It also completes over 90% of a set of system proof tasks not part of VeruSAGE-Bench because they had not yet been finished by human experts. This result shows the great potential for LLM-assisted development of verified system software.</p></details> |  |

The LLM agents produce rule-based Python code for a generator for the given domain, based on RDF triples only, with no in-domain human reference texts. The resulting system is fully interpretable, requires no supervised training data, and generates text nearly instantaneously using only a single CPU. Our experiments on the WebNLG and OpenDialKG data show that outputs produced by our approach reduce hallucination, with only slight fluency penalties compared to finetuned or prompted language models</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Prior efforts primarily studied the success of negotiation agents. Here, we shift the focus towards the styles of negotiation strategies. Our focus is the strategic dialogue board game Diplomacy, which affords rich natural language negotiation and measures of game success. We used LLM-as-a-judge to annotate a large human-human set of Diplomacy games for fine-grained negotiation tactics from a sociologically-grounded taxonomy. Using a combination of the It Takes Two and WebDiplomacy datasets, we demonstrate the reliability of our LLM-as-a-Judge framework and show strong correlations between negotiation features and success in the Diplomacy setting. Lastly, we investigate the differences between LLM and human negotiation strategies and show that fine-tuning can steer LLM agents toward more human-like negotiation behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, accepted for oral presentation at AAAI Human Machine Collaboration Workshop 2026</p></details> |
| **[Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations. We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase. We release a preview version at: https://github.com/Hanchenli/vllm-continuum</p></details> |  |
| **[WebATLAS: An LLM Agent with Experience-Driven Memory and Action Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22732v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) web agents often struggle with long-horizon web navigation and web task completion in new websites, producing inefficient action sequences unless fine-tuned on environment-specific data. We show that experience-driven memory, combined with look-ahead action simulation, is sufficient for LLM agents to adapt to unseen web environments by remembering past failures and predicting the consequences of future actions. We introduce WebATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented LLM web agent that learns a lightweight internal model of the environment from interaction experience and performs hypothetical action rollouts before acting in the real world. WebATLAS builds a persistent cognitive map via curiosity-driven exploration, stores interaction outcomes as experience-based memory, and evaluates candidate actions in cognitive space using a planner--simulator--critic loop. This enables the agent to reuse past experience, avoid previously unsuccessful behaviors, and generate more efficient plans. We evaluate WebATLAS on the WebArena-Lite benchmark for autonomous web navigation and demonstrate a success rate of 63%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art at 53.9%. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that experience-driven memory, look-ahead action simulation, and hierarchical replanning play complementary roles in enabling robust, training-free web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Language Agents and World Models</p></details> |
| **[Helmsman: Autonomous Synthesis of Federated Learning Systems via Collaborative LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14512v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select, combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck, resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a principled research and development workflow through three collaborative phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with, and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Contextualize Web Pages for Enhanced Decision Making by LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10689v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a growing interest in developing LLM-based agents for automating web tasks. However, these agents often struggle with even simple tasks on real-world websites due to their limited capability to understand and process complex web page structures. In this work, we introduce LCoW, a framework for Learning language models to Contextualize complex Web pages into a more comprehensible form, thereby enhancing decision making by LLM agents. LCoW decouples web page understanding from decision making by training a separate contextualization module to transform complex web pages into comprehensible format, which are then utilized by the decision-making agent. We demonstrate that our contextualization module effectively integrates with LLM agents of various scales to significantly enhance their decision-making capabilities in web automation tasks. Notably, LCoW improves the success rates of closed-source LLMs (e.g., Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) by an average of 15.6%, and demonstrates a 23.7% average improvement in success rates for open-source LMs (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B) on the WorkArena benchmark. Moreover, the Gemini-1.5-flash agent with LCoW achieves state-of-the-art results on the WebShop benchmark, outperforming human experts.

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Workshop on WoMAPF, Camera ready version</p></details> |

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 39th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 39)</p></details> |

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-RL Induces Exploration in Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16848v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to perceive, reason, and act through natural language understanding enables autonomous problem-solving in complex pervasive environments, including the management of heterogeneous sensors, devices, and data. This survey outlines the architectural components of LLM agents (profiling, memory, planning, and action) and examines their deployment and evaluation across various scenarios. Than it reviews computational and infrastructural advancements (cloud to edge) in pervasive computing and how AI is moving in this field. It highlights state-of-the-art agent deployment strategies and applications, including local and distributed execution on resource-constrained devices. This survey identifies key challenges of these agents in pervasive computing such as architectural, energetic and privacy limitations. It finally proposes what we called "Agent as a Tool", a conceptual framework for pervasive agentic AI, emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAACE: A Plan-Aware Automated Agent Context Engineering Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16970v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in complex, multi-step workflows involving planning, tool use, reflection, and interaction with external knowledge systems. These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97 percent of the teacher's performance while reducing inference cost by over an order of magnitude, enabling practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models.</p></details> |  |

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages |

For network troubleshooting, progress is hindered by the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic network settings at low operational effort. We present NIKA, the largest public benchmark to date for LLM-driven network incident diagnosis and troubleshooting. NIKA targets both domain experts and especially AI researchers alike, providing zero-effort replay of real-world network scenarios, and establishing well-defined agent-network interfaces for quick agent prototyping. NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents on NIKA and find that while larger models succeed more often in detecting network issues, they still struggle to localize faults and identify root causes. NIKA is open-source and available to the community: https://github.com/sands-lab/nika.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryGraft: Persistent Compromise of LLM Agents via Poisoned Experience Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16962v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on long-term memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to persist experiences and refine future performance. While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and evaluation data are available at https://github.com/Jacobhhy/Agent-Memory-Poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, includes appendix</p></details> |

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy. We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs). We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Trace to Line: LLM Agent for Real-World OSS Vulnerability Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02389v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and focus on coarse function or file level detections which offers limited actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent (Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses run-time evidence such as crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 11th IEEE WIECON-ECE 2025</p></details> |

Machine learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone of AI-assisted discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Prompt Evolution for Enhancing Agent Effectiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15374v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.</p></details> |  |

However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

| **[Imitation Learning for Multi-turn LM Agents via On-policy Expert Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14895v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.</p></details> |  |

We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings). For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records. In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-First Reasoning LLM Agents: Reducing Hallucinations through Explicit Problem Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14474v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically "analysis paralysis" or "cognitive haste"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Task Completion: An Assessment Framework for Evaluating Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12791v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in agentic AI have shifted the focus from standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrated systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. These challenges emerged during our ongoing industry collaboration with MontyCloud Inc., when we deployed an agentic system in production. These limitations surfaced during deployment, highlighting practical gaps in the current evaluation methods and the need for a systematic assessment of agent behavior beyond task outcomes. Informed by these observations and established definitions of agentic systems, we propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Modern MAS are inherently heterogeneous, integrating conventional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with emerging Large Language Model (LLM) agent architectures utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A critical shared vulnerability is reliance on centralized memory components: the shared Experience Replay (ER) buffer in MARL and the external Knowledge Base (K) in RAG agents. This paper proposes XAMT (Bilevel Optimization for Covert Memory Tampering in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Architectures), a novel framework that formalizes attack generation as a bilevel optimization problem. The Upper Level minimizes perturbation magnitude (delta) to enforce covertness while maximizing system behavior divergence toward an adversary-defined target (Lower Level). We provide rigorous mathematical instantiations for CTDE MARL algorithms and RAG-based LLM agents, demonstrating that bilevel optimization uniquely crafts stealthy, minimal-perturbation poisons evading detection heuristics. Comprehensive experimental protocols utilize SMAC and SafeRAG benchmarks to quantify effectiveness at sub-percent poison rates (less than or equal to 1 percent in MARL, less than or equal to 0.1 percent in RAG). XAMT defines a new unified class of training-time threats essential for developing intrinsically secure MAS, with implications for trust, formal verification, and defensive strategies prioritizing intrinsic safety over perimeter-based detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency. To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors. Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. In addition, AutoTool exhibits stronger generalization by dynamically leveraging unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award at ICCV 2025 Workshop on Multi-Modal Reasoning for Agentic Intelligence</p></details> |

With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics. We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically "tweaks" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data. In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/ReachalWang/ObliInjection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NDSS 2026.

However, the rapid growth of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced security practices, leading to brittle integrations that rely on ad-hoc authentication, inconsistent schemas, and weak validation. This survey introduces a unified end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, covering host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications. We systematically categorize more than thirty attack techniques spanning input manipulation, model compromise, system and privacy attacks, and protocol-level vulnerabilities. For each category, we provide a formal threat formulation defining attacker capabilities, objectives, and affected system layers. Representative examples include Prompt-to-SQL injections and the Toxic Agent Flow exploit in GitHub MCP servers. We analyze attack feasibility, review existing defenses, and discuss mitigation strategies such as dynamic trust management, cryptographic provenance tracking, and sandboxed agent interfaces. The framework is validated through expert review and cross-mapping with real-world incidents and public vulnerability repositories, including CVE and NIST NVD. Compared to prior surveys, this work presents the first integrated taxonomy bridging input-level exploits and protocol-layer vulnerabilities in LLM-agent ecosystems, offering actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient agentic AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is published in ICT Express (Elsevier)</p></details> |

We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics, and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model) reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others' falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms, alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages, 31 pages</p></details> |

However, their performance is often crippled by "Context Explosion", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM '26 Oral</p></details> |

No existing XAI methods address tool-level explanations. We introduce AgentSHAP, the first framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents. AgentSHAP is model-agnostic: it treats the agent as a black box and works with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) without needing access to internal weights or gradients. Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools. AgentSHAP joins TokenSHAP (for tokens) and PixelSHAP (for image regions) to complete a family of Shapley-based XAI tools for modern generative AI.

Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.</p></details> |  |

We focus on mixed-motive social dilemmas instantiated as a \textit{Tragedy of the Commons} environment from the Melting Pot suite, where we systematically compare human groups and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, each evaluated with and without explicit communication. Cooperative resilience is assessed under a continuously disruptive condition induced by a persistent unsustainable consumption bot, together with intermittent environmental shocks implemented as stochastic removal of shared resources across scenarios. This experimental design establishes a benchmark for cooperative resilience across agent architectures and interaction modalities, constituting a key step toward systematically comparing humans and LLM-based agents. Using this framework, we find that human groups with communication achieve the highest cooperative resilience compared to all other groups. Communication also improves the resilience of LLM agents, but their performance remains below human levels. Motivated by the performance of humans, we further examine a long-horizon setting with harsher environmental conditions, where humans sustain the shared resource and maintain high resilience in diverse disruption scenarios. Together, these results suggest that human decision-making under adverse social conditions can inform the design of artificial agents that promote prosocial and resilient behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material in https://github.com/mavivi95/resilience_humans_vs_LLM/blob/main/Supplementary_File.pdf</p></details> |

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.</p></details> |  |

We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals. The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on Trust and Control in Agentic AI (TrustAgent)</p></details> |

However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Automated Penetration Testing with LLM Agents and Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11143v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While penetration testing plays a vital role in cybersecurity, achieving fully automated, hands-off-the-keyboard execution remains a significant research challenge. In this paper, we introduce the "Planner-Executor-Perceptor (PEP)" design paradigm and use it to systematically review existing work and identify the key challenges in this area. We also evaluate existing penetration testing systems, with a particular focus on the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. The results show that the out-of-the-box Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5 exhibit superior penetration capabilities observed to date, substantially outperforming all prior systems. However, a detailed analysis of their testing processes reveals specific strengths and limitations; notably, LLM agents struggle with maintaining coherent long-horizon plans, performing complex reasoning, and effectively utilizing specialized tools. These limitations significantly constrain its overall capability, efficiency, and stability. To address these limitations, we propose CHECKMATE, a framework that integrates enhanced classical planning with LLM agents, providing an external, structured "brain" that mitigates the inherent weaknesses of LLM agents. Our evaluation shows that CHECKMATE outperforms the state-of-the-art system (Claude Code) in penetration capability, improving benchmark success rates by over 20%. In addition, it delivers substantially greater stability, cutting both time and monetary costs by more than 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Reasoning: Training-Free Interactive Thinking LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10931v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cross-modal Retrieval Models for Stripped Binary Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10393v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-agent based binary code analysis has demonstrated significant potential across a wide range of software security scenarios, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, etc. In agent workflow, however, retrieving the positive from thousands of stripped binary functions based on user query remains under-studied and challenging, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes it from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[AutoMedic: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Clinical Conversational Agents with Medical Dataset Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10195v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.</p></details> |  |

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AAAI 2026 Workshop on Personalization in the Era of Large Foundation Models (PerFM), 5 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills. Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering: Orchestrating Users and Items for Agentic Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18413v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Injection Attacks on LLM Agents via Query-Only Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v4)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement. Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies. We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators. Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications. We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation. We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models.</p></details> |  |

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.</p></details> |  |

Yet many agent communication and commerce protocols treat agents as low-cost identities, despite the empirical reality that LLM agents remain unreliable, hallucinated, manipulable, and vulnerable to prompt-injection and tool-abuse. A natural response is "agents-at-stake": binding economically meaningful, slashable collateral to persistent identities and adjudicating misbehavior with verifiable evidence. However, heterogeneous tasks make universal verification brittle and centralization-prone, while traditional reputation struggles under rapid model drift and opaque internal states. We propose a protocol-native alternative: insured agents. Specialized insurer agents post stake on behalf of operational agents in exchange for premiums, and receive privileged, privacy-preserving audit access via TEEs to assess claims. A hierarchical insurer market calibrates stake through pricing, decentralizes verification via competitive underwriting, and yields incentive-compatible dispute resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Design Space Exploration in Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08476v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE. We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using counterfactual law shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>71 pa...</summary><p>71 pages, 21 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.</p></details> |  |

While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents.

However, their underlying reasoning "algorithms" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection.

| **[Chat with UAV -- Human-UAV Interaction Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08145v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs. This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics. Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance. Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)</p></details> |
| **[Automating High Energy Physics Data Analysis with LLM-Powered Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07785v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the use of large language model (LLM) agents to automate a representative high energy physics (HEP) analysis. Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager. In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings. Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results. This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments. The baseline code used in this work is available at https://huggingface.co/HWresearch/LLM4HEP.

To design and implement LLM agents around reliable operations, we should consider the task complexity in the application settings and reduce their limitations while striving to minimize agent failures and optimize resource efficiency. High-functioning human organizations have faced similar balancing issues, which led to evidence-based theories that seek to understand their functioning strategies. We examine the parallels between LLM agents and the compatible frameworks in organization science, focusing on what the design, scaling, and management of organizations can inform agentic systems towards improving reliability. We offer three preliminary accounts of organizational principles for AI agent engineering to attain reliability and effectiveness, through balancing agency and capabilities in agent design, resource constraints and performance benefits in agent scaling, and internal and external mechanisms in agent management. Our work extends the growing exchanges between the operational and governance principles of AI systems and social systems to facilitate system integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages incl. references, comments are welcome</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral presentation at AAAI 2026.

| **[Adversarial Agent Collaboration for C to Rust Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03879v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating C to memory-safe languages, like Rust, prevents critical memory safety vulnerabilities that are prevalent in legacy C software. Existing approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not generalize on larger (> 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR (Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command-line utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 473 lines of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention during translation. To our knowledge, it is the first work to show evidence that an agent-centric approach can reliably and automatically convert standalone command-line C programs at this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by up to 25.1% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering Agent as AI Software Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work.

| **[SimuHome: A Temporal- and Environment-Aware Benchmark for Smart Home LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24282v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol, the global industry standard for smart home communication, SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 16 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals distinct capabilities and limitations across models. Models under 7B parameters exhibited negligible performance across all query types. Even GPT-4.1, the best-performing standard model, struggled with implicit intent inference, state verification, and particularly temporal scheduling. While reasoning models such as GPT-5.1 consistently outperformed standard models on every query type, they required over three times the average inference time, which can be prohibitive for real-time smart home applications. This highlights a critical trade-off between task performance and real-world practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[SIT-Graph: State Integrated Tool Graph for Multi-Turn Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive advances in agent systems, multi-turn tool-use scenarios remain challenging. It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.</p></details> |  |

However, existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment. Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800 million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation for future research and real-world applications.

| **[Black-Box Behavioral Distillation Breaks Safety Alignment in Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09403v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored. We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments. Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Framework for Evaluating Medical AI Security: Reproducible Assessment of Jailbreaking and Privacy Vulnerabilities Across Clinical Specialties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08185v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for clinical decision support across diverse specialties, yet systematic evaluation of their robustness to adversarial misuse and privacy leakage remains inaccessible to most researchers. Existing security benchmarks require GPU clusters, commercial API access, or protected health data -- barriers that limit community participation in this critical research area. We propose a practical, fully reproducible framework for evaluating medical AI security under realistic resource constraints. Our framework design covers multiple medical specialties stratified by clinical risk -- from high-risk domains such as emergency medicine and psychiatry to general practice -- addressing jailbreaking attacks (role-playing, authority impersonation, multi-turn manipulation) and privacy extraction attacks. All evaluation utilizes synthetic patient records requiring no IRB approval. The framework is designed to run entirely on consumer CPU hardware using freely available models, eliminating cost barriers. We present the framework specification including threat models, data generation methodology, evaluation protocols, and scoring rubrics. This proposal establishes a foundation for comparative security assessment of medical-specialist models and defense mechanisms, advancing the broader goal of ensuring safe and trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, framework proposal</p></details> |

We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.</p></details> |  |

Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.</p></details> | 22 pages 5 figures |

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.</p></details> |  |
| **[CURE: Confidence-driven Unified Reasoning Ensemble Framework for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14353v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical Exams -- Dataset Construction and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11517v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances.

| **[A Multi-granularity Concept Sparse Activation and Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework for Rare Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08529v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 12 pages,3 figures |
| **[End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

| **[ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

| **[EH-Benchmark Ophthalmic Hallucination Benchmark and Agent-Driven Top-Down Traceable Reasoning Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22929v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment.

Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios.

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |

These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks.

Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[MedGo: A Chinese Medical Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20428v1)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models are a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks. The model was evaluated through the public CBLUE benchmark and a manually constructed dataset ClinicalQA. The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field. At present, we have successfully deployed MedGo at Shanghai East Hospital.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions. Our code is released at: https://github.com/MedicineToken/Medical-Graph-RAG.</p></details> |  |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers. To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds. The internal API connection is secured with encryption and strict authentication measures to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access. We evaluated several open-source large language models with 8 billion parameters on four medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and the medical subset of MMLU. The best-performing baselines were used to develop Eir-8B. Our evaluation employed multiple questioning strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble/self-consistency voting methods. Our model outperformed commercially available Thai-language large language models by more than 10%.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

However, a widely accepted and accessible evaluation process for medical LLM, especially in the Chinese context, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce "MedBench", a comprehensive, standardized, and reliable benchmarking system for Chinese medical LLM.

Second, MedBench provides a standardized and fully automatic cloud-based evaluation infrastructure, with physical separations for question and ground truth. Third, MedBench implements dynamic evaluation mechanisms to prevent shortcut learning and answer remembering. Applying MedBench to popular general and medical LLMs, we observe unbiased, reproducible evaluation results largely aligning with medical professionals' perspectives.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam. These results highlight the contribution of our novel training approach in building LLMs for medical applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models.

However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce MedBench, a comprehensive benchmark for the Chinese medical domain, comprising 40,041 questions sourced from authentic examination exercises and medical reports of diverse branches of medicine. In particular, this benchmark is composed of four key components: the Chinese Medical Licensing Examination, the Resident Standardization Training Examination, the Doctor In-Charge Qualification Examination, and real-world clinic cases encompassing examinations, diagnoses, and treatments. MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge. These findings elucidate both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs within the context of MedBench, with the ultimate goal of aiding the medical research community.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI-24 |

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an English version of A Plan Reuse Mechanism for LLM-Driven Agent published in 2024 in the Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |

Despite decades of work, evaluation practice remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics. Modern large language model (LLM) based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond fixed context windows. In such systems, unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence. This paper introduces an evaluation framework that reports boundary density and segment alignment diagnostics (purity and coverage) alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). By separating boundary scoring from boundary selection, we evaluate segmentation quality across density regimes rather than at a single operating point. Cross-dataset evaluation shows that reported performance differences often reflect annotation granularity mismatch rather than boundary placement quality alone. We evaluate structurally distinct segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Boundary-based metrics are strongly coupled to boundary density: threshold sweeps produce larger W-F1 changes than switching between methods. These findings support viewing topic segmentation as a granularity selection problem rather than prediction of a single correct boundary set. This motivates separating boundary scoring from boundary selection for analyzing and tuning segmentation under varying annotation granularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 4 figures.

To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.</p></details> |  |

Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal</p></details> |
| **[Casting a SPELL: Sentence Pairing Exploration for LLM Limitation-breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21236v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.</p></details> | Accepted to FSE 2026 |

This work categorizes memory into parametric (implicit in model weights) and contextual (explicit external data, structured/unstructured) forms, and defines six core operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing, Forgetting, Retrieval, and Condensation. Mapping these dimensions reveals four key research topics: long-term, long-context, parametric modification, and multi-source memory. The taxonomy provides a structured view of memory-related research, benchmarks, and tools, clarifying functional interactions in LLM-based agents and guiding future advancements. The datasets, papers, and tools are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Survey_Memory_in_AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project available at https://github.com/sarapapi/hearing2translate</p></details> |

However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping LLMs via Preference-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12867v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited -- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CAKE: Cascading and Adaptive KV Cache Eviction with Layer Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12491v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing long sequences, boosting demand for key-value (KV) caching. While recent efforts to evict KV cache have alleviated the inference burden, they often fail to allocate resources rationally across layers with different attention patterns. In this paper, we introduce Cascading and Adaptive KV cache Eviction (CAKE), a novel approach that frames KV cache eviction as a "cake-slicing problem." CAKE assesses layer-specific preferences by considering attention dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions, allocates rational cache size for layers accordingly, and manages memory constraints in a cascading manner. This approach enables a global view of cache allocation, adaptively distributing resources across diverse attention mechanisms while maintaining memory budgets. CAKE also employs a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of tokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook temporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show that CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and consistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory constraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves over 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing contexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2.

Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.</p></details> |  |

Aims: Create a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset. Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results: We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation) dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence LLM screening performance between studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>An up...</summary><p>An updated post-print on the paper published in the Proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM '25). 12 pages (10 + 2 pages for references)</p></details> |
| **[Encrypted Traffic Detection in Resource Constrained IoT Networks: A Diffusion Model and LLM Integrated Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21144v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Emotion Diffusion in Real and Simulated Social Graphs: Structural Limits of LLM-Based Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21138v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-World Evaluation of LLM Medication Safety Reviews in NHS Primary Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21127v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |

VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00162v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores. While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 23 figures</p></details> |

Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21106v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs.

To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer programs are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some minor typo errors are corrected, https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IdiF7M0AAAAJ</p></details> |

Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21066v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Epitome (www.epitome-ai.com), an open experimental platform that operationalizes this paradigm through Matrix-like social worlds where researchers can study isolated human subjects and groups interacting with LLM agents. This maintains ecological validity while enabling precise manipulation of social dynamics. Epitome approaches three frontiers: (1) methodological innovation using LLM confederates to reduce complexity while scaling interactions; (2) empirical investigation of human behavior in AI-saturated environments; and (3) exploration of emergent properties in hybrid collectives. Drawing on interdisciplinary foundations from management, communication, sociology, psychology, and ethics, the platform's modular architecture spans foundation model deployment through data collection. We validate Epitome through replication of three seminal experiments, demonstrating capacity to generate robust findings while reducing experimental complexity. This tool provides crucial insights for understanding how humans navigate AI-mediated social realities, knowledge essential for policy, education, and human-centered AI design.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6figures |

While recent advances in this area have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models (LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration. In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.

This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets "articulation work" as a form of "invisible labour". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for "unfinished" systems can simultaneously create unofficial "shadow" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Stochastic activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22358v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways: (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup on CPU and GPU. This leads to better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function. (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for sequence generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it has higher diversity and has only slightly inferior performance to the best deterministic non-linearity, SILU, combined with temperature sampling. This provides an alternative way to increase the diversity of generated text.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on a survey (N = 202) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots "real" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improved visualizations, and corrected analysis error that had swapped reports of "Respect" and "Shame."

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages (8 pages for Appendix), 4 figures, for Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference to be held in 2026, Norway (LAK26)</p></details> |

Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been reviewed and accepted to the Short Papers and Posters Track of SANER 2026</p></details> |
| **[Artificial or Just Artful? Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21028v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models. In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 20 figures, conference, accepted by HPCA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Policy-Conditioned Policies for Multi-Agent Task Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21024v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.</p></details> |  |

Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.</p></details> | ICSE 2026 |

This addresses a critical and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained data selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/r2llab/SynQuE</p></details> |

However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.</p></details> |  |

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.</p></details> | 18 pages |

As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'26</p></details> |

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation. We introduce Code2Doc, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6% satisfy all quality constraints. We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size. We release both the dataset and the full curation pipeline to support reproducible research on automatic code documentation generation.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.</p></details> |  |

Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAO-Agent: Zero Knowledge-Verified Incentives for Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20973v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms. Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-R1: Enhancing Anatomy Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models via Anatomical Similarity Curriculum and Group Diversity Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19512v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Agentic AI Match the Performance of Human Data Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20959v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressed Causal Reasoning: Quantization and GraphRAG Effects on Interventional and Counterfactual Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13725v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Tool Is Enough: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20957v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.</p></details> |  |

We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of large language models (LLMs), addressing critical research questions on the evolution and determinants of model safety. Specifically, we begin by identifying the most effective techniques for detecting jailbreak attacks. Next, we investigate whether newer versions of LLMs offer improved security compared to their predecessors. We also assess the impact of model size on overall security and explore the potential benefits of integrating multiple defense strategies to enhance the security. Our study evaluates both open-source (e.g., LLaMA and Mistral) and closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) by employing four state-of-the-art attack techniques and assessing the efficacy of three new defensive approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems. Associated code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.</p></details> | Under submission |

Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Computers.

Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Adaptive Financial Sentiment Analysis for NIFTY 50 via Instruction-Tuned LLMs , RAG and Reinforcement Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20082v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CODS 2025</p></details> |

However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R^2 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLegal-Bench: Cognitively Grounded Benchmark for Vietnamese Legal Reasoning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14554v4)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, the Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems. To facilitate access and reproducibility, we provide a public landing page for this benchmark at https://vilegalbench.cmcai.vn/.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on Chinese medical examination questions, encompassing seven medical specialties across two professional levels. We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures. The evaluation demonstrates significant performance gaps between medical specialties, with models generally performing better on cardiovascular and neurology questions compared to gastroenterology and nephrology domains. Furthermore, our analysis indicates minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top-performing models, suggesting robust generalization capabilities. This benchmark provides critical insights for the deployment of LLMs in medical education and clinical decision support systems, highlighting both the promise and current limitations of these technologies in specialized medical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 images |

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing SDS are limited to conventional spoken responses. We present SingingSDS, a cascaded SDS that responds through singing rather than speaking, fostering more affective, memorable, and pleasurable interactions in character-based roleplay and interactive entertainment scenarios. SingingSDS employs a modular ASR-LLM-SVS pipeline and supports a wide range of configurations across character personas, ASR and LLM backends, SVS models, melody sources, and voice profiles, tailored to different needs in terms of latency, quality, and musical style.

Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline. We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses. To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support. ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect, Explain, Escalate: Sustainable Dialogue Breakdown Management for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial capabilities in conversational AI applications, yet their susceptibility to dialogue breakdowns poses significant challenges to deployment reliability and user trust. This paper introduces a "Detect, Explain, Escalate" framework to manage dialogue breakdowns in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing resource-efficient operation. Our approach integrates two key strategies: (1) We fine-tune a compact 8B-parameter model, augmented with teacher-generated reasoning traces, which serves as an efficient real-time breakdown detector and explainer. This model demonstrates robust classification and calibration on English and Japanese dialogues, and generalizes to the BETOLD dataset, improving accuracy by 7% over its baseline. (2) We systematically evaluate frontier LLMs using advanced prompting (few-shot, chain-of-thought, analogical reasoning) for high-fidelity breakdown assessment. These are integrated into an "escalation" architecture where our efficient detector defers to larger models only when necessary, substantially reducing operational costs and computational overhead. Our fine-tuned model and prompting strategies achieve state-of-the-art performance on DBDC5 and strong results on BETOLD, outperforming specialized classifiers on DBDC5 and narrowing the performance gap to larger proprietary models. The proposed monitor-escalate pipeline reduces inference costs by 54%, providing a cost-effective and interpretable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains. Code and models will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MediEval: A Unified Medical Benchmark for Patient-Contextual and Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20822v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Deception: When Reasoning Models Can't Compute an Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20812v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.</p></details> |  |

Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Filtering: Guiding Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval with Prescriptive and Proscriptive Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20781v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image that aligns with user intent, expressed through a reference image and a modification text. While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on New Frontiers in Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Is Enough: LLMs Are In-Context Reinforcement Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06303v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for solving sequential decision-making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, RL emerges during the inference time of large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon we term in-context RL (ICRL). To reveal this capability, we introduce a simple multi-round prompting framework, we call ICRL prompting, for inference-time self-improvement. The goal of ICRL prompting is to guide LLMs to perform reinforcement learning during inference for self-improvement on a given task. After each response, the model receives numerical scalar feedback, denoted as a reward. In the next round, we prompt the LLM again together with a context that concatenates all prior responses and their associated rewards. We consistently observe that response quality improves as the context grows. In other words, the LLM can optimize scalar reward signals during inference, exhibiting behavior analogous to reinforcement learning. We evaluate ICRL prompting on Game of 24, creative writing, ScienceWorld, and Olympiad-level math competitions (AIME and HMMT), demonstrating significant improvements over baselines such as Self-Refine and Reflexion. Notably, even when the reward signals are generated by the same LLM, ICRL prompting still improves performance, highlighting a promising new paradigm for test-time scaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of RLVR Using Causal Reasoning as a Testbed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20760v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM, ...</summary><p>LLM, Mathematical Reasoning</p></details> |

As such, we present AutoAdv, a novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT (arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns. Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>We en...</summary><p>We encountered issues with the paper being hosted under my personal account, so we republished it under a different account associated with a university email, which makes updates and management easier.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework: (1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark, performing comparable with the Gemini-3.0-pro model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) and outperforms the GPT-4o model 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Generalization experiments also show that our framework can effectively benefit general VQA and visual reasoning tasks. Additionally, our work provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI interaction.

| **[Making Large Language Models Efficient Dense Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20612v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that directly fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for dense retrieval yields strong performance, but their substantial parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.</p></details> |  |

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12140v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeMed-R1: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable and Robust Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19317v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision--Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet their deployment in clinical settings is hindered by severe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NEURO-GUARD: Neuro-Symbolic Generalization and Unbiased Adaptive Routing for Diagnostics -- Explainable Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18177v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a central challenge in medical AI, particularly in settings characterized by limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes clinical decision-making. Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods. Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Asilomar Conference</p></details> |
| **[MedCEG: Reinforcing Verifiable Medical Reasoning with Critical Evidence Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13510v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models with reasoning capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of domains. In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality. Experimental results show that MedCEG surpasses existing methods in performance while producing clinically valid reasoning chains, representing a solid advancement in reliable medical AI reasoning. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LinjieMu/MedCEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[DL$^3$M: A Vision-to-Language Framework for Expert-Level Medical Reasoning through Deep Learning and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13742v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems. The complete source code and datasets used in this study are available at https://github.com/souravbasakshuvo/DL3M.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-REFL: Medical Reasoning Enhancement via Self-Corrected Fine-grained Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13793v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models excel in domains like mathematics where intermediate reasoning is straightforward to verify, but struggle to self-correct in medicine fields where evaluating intermediate reasoning is cumbersome and expensive. This verification bottleneck hinders the development of reliable AI reasoners for high-stakes application. Here we propose Med-REFL, a novel framework that learns fine-grained reflection without human labels or model distillation. Med-REFL introduces a deterministic structural assessment of the reasoning space to automatically generate preference data for reflection. By globally evaluating all explored reasoning paths in a tree-of-thoughts, our method quantifies the value of corrective actions, enabling the automated construction of direct preference optimization pairs. This trains the model to recognize and amend its own reasoning fallacies. Extensive experiments show Med-REFL delivers robust gains across diverse models architectures and medical benchmarks, boosting a general-purpose Llama3.1-8B by +5.82% and the state-of-the-art Huatuo-o1 by +4.13% on the MedQA benchmark. Our Med-REFL-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-8B models while even competing with models twice its size. Crucially, targeted ablations prove its success generalizes to other domains such as logical reasoning and mitigates the `fake reflection' phenomenon in LRMs. Ultimately, our framework provides a scalable solution to the verification bottleneck, paving the way for more reliable AI reasoners in high-stakes domains like medicine. Med-REFL has been made publicly available in https://github.com/TianYin123/Med-REFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | AAAI2026 |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Grounded Multilingual Medical Reasoning for Question Answering with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05658v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03838v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-CMR: A Fine-Grained Benchmark Integrating Visual Evidence and Clinical Logic for Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00818v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLLMs MLLMs are beginning to appear in clinical workflows, but their ability to perform complex medical reasoning remains unclear. We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  |

We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI-26 (ORAL)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01450v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms baseline methods, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mihara-bot/DIQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 12pages, 6 figures |

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Hallucinations in Foundation Models and Their Impact on Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05777v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in foundation models arise from autoregressive training objectives that prioritize token-likelihood optimization over epistemic accuracy, fostering overconfidence and poorly calibrated uncertainty. We define medical hallucination as any model-generated output that is factually incorrect, logically inconsistent, or unsupported by authoritative clinical evidence in ways that could alter clinical decisions. We evaluated 11 foundation models (7 general-purpose, 4 medical-specialized) across seven medical hallucination tasks spanning medical reasoning and biomedical information retrieval. General-purpose models achieved significantly higher proportions of hallucination-free responses than medical-specialized models (median: 76.6% vs 51.3%, difference = 25.2%, 95% CI: 18.7-31.3%, Mann-Whitney U = 27.0, p = 0.012, rank-biserial r = -0.64). Top-performing models such as Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 97% accuracy when augmented with chain-of-thought prompting (base: 87.6%), while medical-specialized models like MedGemma ranged from 28.6-61.9% despite explicit training on medical corpora. Chain-of-thought reasoning significantly reduced hallucinations in 86.4% of tested comparisons after FDR correction (q < 0.05), demonstrating that explicit reasoning traces enable self-verification and error detection. Physician audits confirmed that 64-72% of residual hallucinations stemmed from causal or temporal reasoning failures rather than knowledge gaps. A global survey of clinicians (n = 70) validated real-world impact: 91.8% had encountered medical hallucinations, and 84.7% considered them capable of causing patient harm. The underperformance of medical-specialized models despite domain training indicates that safety emerges from sophisticated reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge integration developed during large-scale pre-training, not from narrow optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedRECT: A Medical Reasoning Benchmark for Error Correction in Clinical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00421v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Role Cognition in Medical LLMs via Neuronal Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24677v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems, particularly in the context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP), instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the related code in the following repository:https: //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[S-Chain: Structured Visual Chain-of-Thought For Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22728v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16 languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability. Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med, LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity, and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning, improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and explainable medical VLMs.</p></details> | First version |

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective. Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Reasoning-with-Retrieval Framework for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18303v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[BenCao: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17415v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triplet-Structured Knowledge Integration for Multi-Turn Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03536v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.</p></details> | Preprint |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60% compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |

Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.</p></details> |  |

However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings.

Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.</p></details> | 51 pages, 27 figures |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process, limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge. In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$ constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets, outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAGE: Scaling Test-Time Inference with Parallel Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18260v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking GPT-5 for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning in Radiology and Radiation Oncology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13192v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02669v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d</p></details> |

The challenge focuses on developing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models that answer clinically relevant questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing interpretable justifications aligned with medical reasoning. It introduces two subtasks: (1) answering diverse types of visual questions using the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, and (2) generating multimodal explanations to support clinical decision-making. The Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, created from 6,500 images and 159,549 complex question-answer (QA) pairs, serves as the benchmark for the challenge. By combining quantitative performance metrics and expert-reviewed explainability assessments, this task aims to advance trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis.

| **[MedAtlas: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Round, Multi-Task Medical Reasoning Across Diverse Imaging Modalities and Clinical Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10947v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.26% and +26.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</p></details> | Corrected some typos |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCoT: Communication-Efficient Federated Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10020v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover, existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.</p></details> |  |

This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning.

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025 (main track)</p></details> |

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based agents in medicine, examining their architectures, applications, and challenges. We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception.

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B.

While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new evaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical reasoning models.

| **[m1: Unleash the Potential of Test-Time Scaling for Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00869v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |
| **[Medical Reasoning in LLMs: An In-Depth Analysis of DeepSeek R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00016v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 into healthcare requires rigorous evaluation of their reasoning alignment with clinical expertise. This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07459v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedVLM-R1: Incentivizing Medical Reasoning Capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19634v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where transparency and trustworthiness play a central role in both clinician trust and regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

| **[Towards Conversational AI for Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06074v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Structured Outputs Enable General-Purpose LLMs to be Medical Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03194v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question-answering (QA) is a critical task for evaluating how effectively large language models (LLMs) encode clinical knowledge and assessing their potential applications in medicine. Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-RLVR: Emerging Medical Reasoning from a 3B base model via reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19655v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently gained attention for its ability to elicit self-evolved reasoning capabilitie from base language models without explicit reasoning supervisions, as demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Citrus: Leveraging Expert Cognitive Pathways in a Medical Language Model for Advanced Medical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18274v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities, have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential across a wide range of applications. However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Problem-Solving Arising from Inflexible Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04381v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level accuracy on medical question-answer (QA) benchmarks. However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tree-based RAG-Agent Recommendation System: A Case Study in Medical Test Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02727v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HiRMed (Hierarchical RAG-enhanced Medical Test Recommendation), a novel tree-structured recommendation system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical test recommendations. Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[HuatuoGPT-o1, Towards Medical Complex Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18925v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedG-KRP: Medical Graph Knowledge Representation Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10982v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools, finding many medical applications. LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |
