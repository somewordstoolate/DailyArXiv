| **[AgentA/B: Automated and Scalable Web A/BTesting with Interactive LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09723v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A/B testing experiment is a widely adopted method for evaluating UI/UX design decisions in modern web applications. Yet, traditional A/B testing remains constrained by its dependence on the large-scale and live traffic of human participants, and the long time of waiting for the testing result. Through formative interviews with six experienced industry practitioners, we identified critical bottlenecks in current A/B testing workflows. In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents Amazon.com, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale. Our findings suggest AgentA/B can emulate human-like behavior patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[UXAgent: A System for Simulating Usability Testing of Web Design with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09407v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Usability testing is a fundamental research method that user experience (UX) researchers use to evaluate and iterate their new designs. But what about evaluating and iterating the usability testing study design itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and iterating their study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users and to interactively test the target website. The system also provides a Result Viewer Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative (e.g., agents' post-study surveys) and quantitative data (e.g., agents' interaction logs), or even interview agents directly. Through a heuristic evaluation with 16 UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Visual Continual Learning with Multi-Prototype Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16011v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes. Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for language-guided continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Self-improvement LLM Agentic System for ML Library Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02534v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ML libraries, often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures, are key to efficient ML systems. However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agents at the Roundtable: A Multi-Perspective and Dialectical Reasoning Framework for Essay Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14834v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[How do Language Models Generate Slang: A Systematic Comparison between Human and Machine-Generated Slang Usages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15518v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slang is a commonly used type of informal language that poses a daunting challenge to NLP systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), however, have made the problem more approachable. While LLM agents are becoming more widely applied to intermediary tasks such as slang detection and slang interpretation, their generalizability and reliability are heavily dependent on whether these models have captured structural knowledge about slang that align well with human attested slang usages. To answer this question, we contribute a systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2) Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang. Our results suggest that while LLMs have captured significant knowledge about the creative aspects of slang, such knowledge does not align with humans sufficiently to enable LLMs for extrapolative tasks such as linguistic analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostics of cognitive failures in multi-agent expert systems using dynamic evaluation protocols and subsequent mutation of the processing context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15366v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of neural architectures - from multilayer perceptrons to large-scale Transformer-based models - has enabled language models (LLMs) to exhibit emergent agentic behaviours when equipped with memory, planning, and external tool use. However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing, extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents toward expert-level reasoning and style. The results establish a foundation for standardized, reproducible expert behaviour transfer in stochastic, tool-augmented LLM agents, moving beyond static evaluation to active expert system refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Disse...</summary><p>Dissertation and research project created in collaboration with JobFair LTD</p></details> |
| **[A Knowledge-driven Adaptive Collaboration of LLMs for Enhancing Medical Decision-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14998v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/KAMAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[SWE-QA: Can Language Models Answer Repository-level Code Questions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14635v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA) benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies. Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing open challenges and pointing to future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/peng-weihan/SWE-QA-Bench</p></details> |
| **[Ticket-Bench: A Kickoff for Multilingual and Regionalized Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14477v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios. Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of robust LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoSizing: An LLM-aided Framework of Topology-based Understanding and Sizing for AMS Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14169v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog and mixed-signal circuit design remains challenging due to the shortage of high-quality data and the difficulty of embedding domain knowledge into automated flows. Traditional black-box optimization achieves sampling efficiency but lacks circuit understanding, which often causes evaluations to be wasted in low-value regions of the design space. In contrast, learning-based methods embed structural knowledge but are case-specific and costly to retrain. Recent attempts with large language models show potential, yet they often rely on manual intervention, limiting generality and transparency. We propose TopoSizing, an end-to-end framework that performs robust circuit understanding directly from raw netlists and translates this knowledge into optimization gains. Our approach first applies graph algorithms to organize circuits into a hierarchical device-module-stage representation. LLM agents then execute an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement loop with built-in consistency checks, producing explicit annotations. Verified insights are integrated into Bayesian optimization through LLM-guided initial sampling and stagnation-triggered trust-region updates, improving efficiency while preserving feasibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM Agents for Interactive Workflow Provenance: Reference Architecture and Evaluation Methodology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13978v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum. Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC).

| **[Emergent Social Dynamics of LLM Agents in the El Farol Bar Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04537v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives (prompt-specified constraints such as the 60% threshold) and internal incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training), demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric. Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in society.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Agentic JWT: A Secure Delegation Protocol for Autonomous AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13597v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous LLM agents can issue thousands of API calls per hour without human oversight. OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings stochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can silently expand privileges. We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each agent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific workflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash derived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation assertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and per-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process impersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight client shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens, tracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and separation even within a single process. We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications, implement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of scope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways with sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with ongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust guarantees for agentic applications. A comprehensive performance and security evaluation with experimental results will appear in our forthcoming journal publication</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |
| **[AI Agents with Human-Like Collaborative Tools: Adaptive Strategies for Enhanced Problem-Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13547v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether giving LLM agents the collaborative tools and autonomy that humans naturally use for problem solving can improve their performance. We equip Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools and allow them to use these tools as they see fit. Across 34 Aider Polyglot Python programming challenges, collaborative tools substantially improve performance on the hardest problems, delivering 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, and 12-38% faster completion than baseline agents. Effects on the full challenge set are mixed, suggesting these tools act as performance enhancers when additional reasoning scaffolding is most needed. Surprisingly, Different models naturally adopted distinct collaborative strategies without explicit instruction. Sonnet 3.7 engaged broadly across tools and benefited from articulation-based cognitive scaffolding. Sonnet 4 showed selective adoption, leaning on journal-based semantic search when problems were genuinely difficult. This mirrors how human developers adjust collaboration based on expertise and task complexity. Behavioral analysis shows agents prefer writing over reading by about 2-9x, indicating that structured articulation drives much of the improvement rather than information access alone. Overall, AI agents can systematically benefit from human-inspired collaboration tools at the edge of their capabilities, pointing to adaptive collaborative interfaces as reasoning enhancers rather than universal efficiency boosts.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 tables |
| **[An LLM Agentic Approach for Legal-Critical Software: A Case Study for Tax Prep Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13471v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise for translating natural-language statutes into executable logic, but reliability in legally critical settings remains challenging due to ambiguity and hallucinations. We present an agentic approach for developing legal-critical software, using U.S. federal tax preparation as a case study. The key challenge is test-case generation under the oracle problem, where correct outputs require interpreting law. Building on metamorphic testing, we introduce higher-order metamorphic relations that compare system outputs across structured shifts among similar individuals. Because authoring such relations is tedious and error-prone, we use an LLM-driven, role-based framework to automate test generation and code synthesis. We implement a multi-agent system that translates tax code into executable software and incorporates a metamorphic-testing agent that searches for counterexamples. In experiments, our framework using a smaller model (GPT-4o-mini) achieves a worst-case pass rate of 45%, outperforming frontier models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks. These results support agentic LLM methodologies as a path to robust, trustworthy legal-critical software from natural-language specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICSE 26. 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14285v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p></details> |  |

Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. However, on-orbit validation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals performance degradation caused by inference latency mismatched with the rapid thermal cycles characteristic of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These results highlight both the opportunities and current limitations of agentic LLM-based systems in real flight environments, providing practical design guidelines for future space autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint presents ASTREA, a multi-agent architecture combining LLM-guided semantic modulation with reinforcement learning for autonomous satellite operations.

However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-Based Social Bot via an Adversarial Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17711v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/kfq20/EvoBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMPROVE: Iterative Model Pipeline Refinement and Optimization Leveraging LLM Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18530v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redefining Website Fingerprinting Attacks With Multiagent LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12462v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Website Fingerprinting (WFP) uses deep learning models to classify encrypted network traffic to infer visited websites. While historically effective, prior methods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications (SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages, undermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks the behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that users exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing traffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral entropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust performance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop session-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a scalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents. These multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to simulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than human collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from 20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance across human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under 10\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In contrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\% range, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate that for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data quality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is essential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survival at Any Cost? LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12190v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/alirezamohamadiam/DECIDE-SIM</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisDocSketcher: Towards Scalable Visual Documentation with Agentic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11942v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual documentation is an effective tool for reducing the cognitive barrier developers face when understanding unfamiliar code, enabling more intuitive comprehension. Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level understanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer visual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software systems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to evaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing approach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly from code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to standardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the first exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual documentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that combines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code and produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation framework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual documentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our approach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an improvement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation framework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual documentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding 0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual documentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid visual representations but also reliably assess their quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Creation and Enrichment Framework for Improved Invocation of Enterprise APIs as Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11626v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has lead to the development of agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction with external tools. In enterprise contexts, the effective use of such tools that are often enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs), is hindered by poor documentation, complex input or output schema, and large number of operations. These challenges make tool selection difficult and reduce the accuracy of payload formation by up to 25%. We propose ACE, an automated tool creation and enrichment framework that transforms enterprise APIs into LLM-compatible tools. ACE, (i) generates enriched tool specifications with parameter descriptions and examples to improve selection and invocation accuracy, and (ii) incorporates a dynamic shortlisting mechanism that filters relevant tools at runtime, reducing prompt complexity while maintaining scalability. We validate our framework on both proprietary and open-source APIs and demonstrate its integration with agentic frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, ACE is the first end-to-end framework that automates the creation, enrichment, and dynamic selection of enterprise API tools for LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11507v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompts to Proxies: Emulating Human Preferences via a Compact LLM Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11311v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of work originally submitted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Agentic UAVs: LLM-Driven Autonomy with Integrated Tool-Calling and Cognitive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13352v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in defense, surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems remain confined to SAE Level 2--3 autonomy. Their reliance on rule-based control and narrow AI restricts adaptability in dynamic, uncertain missions. Existing UAV frameworks lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level integration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database querying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype integrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3 deployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved higher detection confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), improved person detection rates (91% vs. 75%), and markedly increased action recommendation (92% vs. 4.5%). These results confirm that modest computational overhead enables qualitatively new levels of autonomy and ecosystem integration.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Beyond the Protocol: Unveiling Attack Vectors in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040v4)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to enable seamless interaction between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external tools or resources. Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end empirical evaluation of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. We identify four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate their feasibility, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload -> download -> attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent these threats. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful actions within the user's local environment, such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current MCP security ecosystem. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers and ensure the safe deployment of increasingly autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18039v4)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Free-MAD: Consensus-Free Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11035v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process, causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning performance. To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD} introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.</p></details> |  |

Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

However, their deployment raises serious safety concerns. Existing defenses largely rely on "Safety Checks", which struggle to capture the complex semantic risks posed by harmful user inputs or unsafe agent behaviors - creating a significant semantic gap between safety checks and real-world risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel defense framework, ALRPHFS (Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast & Slow Reasoning). ALRPHFS consists of two core components: (1) an offline adversarial self-learning loop to iteratively refine a generalizable and balanced library of risk patterns, substantially enhancing robustness without retraining the base LLM, and (2) an online hierarchical fast & slow reasoning engine that balances detection effectiveness with computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared to existing baselines, achieving a best-in-class average accuracy of 80% and exhibiting strong generalizability across agents and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 findings, 20 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment, focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a framework of Gamified Personality Assessment through Multi-Personality Representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models to empower virtual agents with different personalities. These agents elicit multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the interaction, it achieves two modes of personality assessment (i.e., Direct Assessment and Questionnaire-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights. Grounded in the classic Big Five personality theory, we developed a prototype system and conducted a user study to evaluate the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results affirm the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and demonstrate its superior performance when considering the multiplicity of personality representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciML Agents: Write the Solver, Not the Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09936v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff), and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems; and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open- and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving simple ODE problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrEnv: Transparently Share Serverless Execution Environments Across Different Functions and Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09525v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, both stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses, accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness, low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity. When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated, context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentGym-RL: Training LLM Agents for Long-Horizon Decision Making through Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08755v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, 39 pages, 16 figures.

However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08646v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoODD: Agentic Audits via Bayesian Red Teaming in Black-Box Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08638v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training, are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance. However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An Agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TheAgentCompany: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Consequential Real World Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14161v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07976v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting In Contract with Large Language Models -- An Agency Theory Perspective On Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07642v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic, discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract) theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment problem-solution space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 19th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik 2024, W\"urzburg, Germany https://aisel.aisnet.org/wi2024/91/</p></details> |

Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning. Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Talking with Oompa Loompas: A novel framework for evaluating linguistic acquisition of LLM agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07389v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models (LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more effectively from interactive feedback.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Autonomous Code Evolution Meets NP-Completeness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07367v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities, enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve} demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++ code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024 codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both 2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> | 31 pages, 11 figures |
| **[EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CancerGUIDE: Cancer Guideline Understanding via Internal Disagreement Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07325v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Attacks of Social Engineering in Multi-turn Conversations: LLM Agents for Simulation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15552v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the SE attack mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at COLM 2025 Workshop on AI Agents: Capabilities and Safety</p></details> |
| **[Spec2RTL-Agent: Automated Hardware Code Generation from Complex Specifications Using LLM Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13905v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in generating hardware RTL code with LLMs, existing solutions still suffer from a substantial gap between practical application scenarios and the requirements of real-world RTL code development. Prior approaches either focus on overly simplified hardware descriptions or depend on extensive human guidance to process complex specifications, limiting their scalability and automation potential. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an LLM agent system, termed Spec2RTL-Agent, designed to directly process complex specification documentation and generate corresponding RTL code implementations, advancing LLM-based RTL code generation toward more realistic application settings. To achieve this goal, Spec2RTL-Agent introduces a novel multi-agent collaboration framework that integrates three key enablers: (1) a reasoning and understanding module that translates specifications into structured, step-by-step implementation plans; (2) a progressive coding and prompt optimization module that iteratively refines the code across multiple representations to enhance correctness and synthesisability for RTL conversion; and (3) an adaptive reflection module that identifies and traces the source of errors during generation, ensuring a more robust code generation flow. Instead of directly generating RTL from natural language, our system strategically generates synthesizable C++ code, which is then optimized for HLS. This agent-driven refinement ensures greater correctness and compatibility compared to naive direct RTL generation approaches. We evaluate Spec2RTL-Agent on three specification documents, showing it generates accurate RTL code with up to 75% fewer human interventions than existing methods. This highlights its role as the first fully automated multi-agent system for RTL generation from unstructured specs, reducing reliance on human effort in hardware design.</p></details> |  |

Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 7 main figures, 2 main tables, accepted to Nature Communications</p></details> |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes, and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure. RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.</p></details> |  |

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Meta-Policy Reflexion: Reusable Reflective Memory and Rule Admissibility for Resource-Efficient LLM Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03990v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral, task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation, present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and multi-agent extensions.</p></details> |  |

We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy AI lifestyle assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at the OARS Workshop, KDD 2025, Paper link: https://oars-workshop.github.io/papers/Raman2025.pdf</p></details> |
| **[TalkToAgent: A Human-centric Explanation of Reinforcement Learning Agents with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04809v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However, there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models (LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator, Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.</p></details> | 31 pages total |

Using a credence goods framework where experts have private information about the optimal service for consumers, we find that Human-Human markets generally achieve higher levels of efficiency than AI-AI and Human-AI markets through pro-social expert preferences and higher consumer trust. Notably, LLM experts still earn substantially higher surplus than human experts -- at the expense of consumer surplus - suggesting adverse incentives that may spur the harmful deployment of LLMs. Concurrently, a majority of human experts chooses to rely on LLM agents when given the opportunity in Human-AI-Human markets, especially if they have agency over the LLM's (social) objective function. Here, a large share of experts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest. Disclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by marginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts. Consequently, Human-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules. With obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert incentives remain. Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and risks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several regulatory challenges. On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust in the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts' other-regarding preferences through automation. On the other hand, LLMs allow experts to codify and communicate their objective function, which reduces information asymmetries and increases efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Roleplay: Examining LLM Alignment in Collaborative Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05882v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and correctness of task outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems face challenges in quantifying agent performance and lack mechanisms to assess agent credibility. To address these issues, we introduce DRF, a dynamic reputation filtering framework. DRF constructs an interactive rating network to quantify agent performance, designs a reputation scoring mechanism to measure agent honesty and capability, and integrates an Upper Confidence Bound - based strategy to enhance agent selection efficiency. Experiments show that DRF significantly improves task completion quality and collaboration efficiency in logical reasoning and code - generation tasks, offering a new approach for multi - agent systems to handle large - scale tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICONIP 2025 but not published</p></details> |
| **[Lessons from Studying Two-Hop Latent Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16353v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models can use chain-of-thought (CoT) to externalize reasoning, potentially enabling oversight of capable LLM agents. Prior work has shown that models struggle at two-hop question-answering without CoT. This capability is so basic that if it was a fundamental limitation, it would imply that many complex agentic tasks would similarly require CoT. We investigate LLM latent reasoning capabilities using two-hop question answering as a case study. Previous work on the gap between latent and externalized two-hop reasoning produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where a positive result provides definitive evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B and GPT-4o) on synthetic facts and test two-hop reasoning over these facts. By using synthetic facts, we rule out memorization and reasoning shortcuts as explanations for two-hop performance. We observe a nuanced picture: Models fail to compose two synthetic facts, but can succeed when one fact is synthetic and the other is natural. These results demonstrate that LLMs are undeniably capable of latent two-hop reasoning, although it remains unclear how this ability scales with model size. Finally, we highlight a lesson for researchers studying LLM reasoning: when drawing conclusions about LLM latent reasoning, one must be careful to avoid both spurious successes (that stem from memorization and reasoning shortcuts) and spurious failures (that may stem from artificial experimental setups, divorced from training setups of frontier LLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |

We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |
| **[AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04365v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, few studies have thoroughly investigated the impact on LLM agents capabilities of fine-tuning them with RL in a specific environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to analyze the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt formulations following RL training in a textual environment. Our findings reveal that the performance of LLMs degrades when faced with prompt formulations different from those used during the RL training phase. Besides, we analyze the source of this sensitivity by examining the model's internal representations and salient tokens. Finally, we propose to use a contrastive loss to mitigate this sensitivity and improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 51 pages.

While prior work has advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states. Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM agent interaction behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Long Paper)</p></details> |

Most existing optimizers tune configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph & configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report by RELAI.ai</p></details> |

Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases.

Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering, enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology, cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent, interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[EQ-Knight: A Memory-Augmented LLM Agent for Strategic Affective Gaming in Debt Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based chatbots have enhanced engagement in financial negotiations, but their overreliance on passive empathy introduces critical risks in credit collection. While empathy-driven approaches preserve client satisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest debtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or evade repayment. Blindly prioritizing "customer experience" in such scenarios leads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic exploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that dynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike naive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and game-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and predict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical emotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g., aggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships. Experiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM negotiators: it achieves a 32\% reduction in concession losses without compromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors weaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce concessions. For credit agencies, EQ-Knight transforms LLMs from high-risk "people-pleasers" into strategic emotion-defenders--balancing emotional intelligence with tactical rigor to enforce accountability and deter exploitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLM Agents the New RPA? A Comparative Study with RPA Across Enterprise Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04198v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm in automation: LLM agents or Agentic Automation with Computer Use (AACU). Unlike traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which relies on rule-based workflows and scripting, AACU enables intelligent agents to perform tasks through natural language instructions and autonomous interaction with user interfaces. This study investigates whether AACU can serve as a viable alternative to RPA in enterprise workflow automation. We conducted controlled experiments across three standard RPA challenges data entry, monitoring, and document extraction comparing RPA (via UiPath) and AACU (via Anthropic's Computer Use Agent) in terms of speed, reliability, and development effort. Results indicate that RPA outperforms AACU in execution speed and reliability, particularly in repetitive, stable environments. However, AACU significantly reduces development time and adapts more flexibly to dynamic interfaces. While current AACU implementations are not yet production-ready, their promise in rapid prototyping and lightweight automation is evident. Future research should explore multi-agent orchestration, hybrid RPA-AACU architectures, and more robust evaluation across industries and platforms.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce MAGneT, a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale (CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3% on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make our code and data public.</p></details> | 25 pages, 29 figures |

The movement of physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes, while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies, especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge, comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools, and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.</p></details> |  |

Latent Profiles for Social Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

| **[Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress. The MoNaCo benchmark, codebase, prompts and models predictions are all publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2025.

| **[Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10978v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis. We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp</p></details> |  |

Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent, our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its optimized execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to CIDR'26</p></details> |
| **[Towards Agents That Know When They Don't Know: Uncertainty as a Control Signal for Structured Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02401v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets. On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration, nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4 internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex structured-data environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02360v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical Exams -- Dataset Construction and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11517v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 12 pages,3 figures |

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |

Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional A/B testing remains constrained by its dependence on the large-scale and live traffic of human participants, and the long time of waiting for the testing result. Through formative interviews with six experienced industry practitioners, we identified critical bottlenecks in current A/B testing workflows. In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents Amazon.com, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale.

But what about evaluating and iterating the usability testing study design itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and iterating their study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users and to interactively test the target website. The system also provides a Result Viewer Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative (e.g., agents' post-study surveys) and quantitative data (e.g., agents' interaction logs), or even interview agents directly. Through a heuristic evaluation with 16 UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Stacked Multi-Model Reasoning (SMMR), a layered framework that leverages multiple LLMs and specialized smaller models as coequal 'experts'. Early layers isolate short, discrete subtasks, while later layers integrate and refine these partial outputs through more advanced long-context models. We evaluate SMMR on the DAIC-WOZ depression-screening dataset and 48 curated case studies with psychiatric diagnoses, demonstrating consistent improvements over single-model baselines in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and PHQ-8 error reduction. By harnessing diverse 'second opinions', SMMR mitigates hallucinations, captures subtle clinical nuances, and enhances reliability in high-stakes mental health assessments. Our findings underscore the value of multi-expert frameworks for more trustworthy AI-driven screening.</p></details> |  |
| **[CultureScope: A Dimensional Lens for Probing Cultural Understanding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16188v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural environments, evaluating their cultural understanding capability has become essential for ensuring trustworthy and culturally aligned applications. However, most existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness and are challenging to scale and adapt across different cultural contexts, because their frameworks often lack guidance from well-established cultural theories and tend to rely on expert-driven manual annotations. To address these issues, we propose CultureScope, the most comprehensive evaluation framework to date for assessing cultural understanding in LLMs. Inspired by the cultural iceberg theory, we design a novel dimensional schema for cultural knowledge classification, comprising 3 layers and 140 dimensions, which guides the automated construction of culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation datasets for any given languages and cultures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively evaluate cultural understanding. They also reveal that existing large language models lack comprehensive cultural competence, and merely incorporating multilingual data does not necessarily enhance cultural understanding.

| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Cross-Attention Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24544v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge, cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative decoding.</p></details> |  |

Yet, computing these frequencies requires manually bucketing idea rephrasings, a process that is subjective, labor-intensive, error-prone, and brittle at scale. We introduce MuseScorer, a fully automated, psychometrically validated system for frequency-based originality scoring. MuseScorer integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with externally orchestrated retrieval: given a new idea, it retrieves semantically similar prior idea-buckets and zero-shot prompts the LLM to judge whether the idea fits an existing bucket or forms a new one. These buckets enable frequency-based originality scoring without human annotation. Across five datasets N_{participants}=1143, n_{ideas}=16,294), MuseScorer matches human annotators in idea clustering structure (AMI = 0.59) and participant-level scoring (r = 0.89), while demonstrating strong convergent and external validity. The system enables scalable, intent-sensitive, and human-aligned originality assessment for creativity research.</p></details> |  |

However, a comparison of various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking. While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations, label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

However, we observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior. While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models (LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning, allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions, without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.</p></details> |  |

Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset.

However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page : https://vatsal-malaviya.github.io/AcT2I/</p></details> |

Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations, reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts (RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4 ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2, RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaseReward: A Strong Baseline for Multimodal Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16127v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model} and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}. Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

By supporting reconfiguration at the functional unit level, CGRAs efficiently adapt to varying computational patterns and optimize resource utilization. However, designing CGRAs is highly challenging due to the vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and the time-consuming nature of manual design. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to automate this process. In this work, we propose MACO -- an open-source multi-agent LLM-based framework for Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design of CGRAs. The framework employs LLM reasoning to generate CGRAs across four stages: HW/SW co-design, Design error correction, Best design selection, and Evaluation & Feedback. Furthermore, MACO iteratively optimizes the generated CGRAs, leveraging agent reasoning and feedback to achieve higher PPA (that is, power, performance, and area) design points for a given domain. In addition, we introduce an LLM self-learning mechanism that employs LLM-driven decision making to select the optimal CGRA to accelerate the design process. We evaluate the framework with state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and manual CGRA design, in terms of performance, power consumption, and area. Experimental results show that MACO efficiently generates high-quality CGRA architectures, significantly reducing manual design effort and demonstrating the potential of our framework for real-world CGRA design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to certain confidentiality requirements, this article needs to be withdrawn</p></details> |

Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Can Large Language Models Infer Causal Relationships from Real-World Text?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18931v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work evaluating LLM causal reasoning primarily focuses on synthetically generated texts which involve straightforward causal relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of explicitness, number of nodes, and causal relationships), and domains and sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on this dataset show that LLMs face significant challenges in inferring causal relationships from real-world text, with the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Through systematic analysis across aspects of real-world text (degree of confounding, size of graph, length of text, domain), our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we systematically investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can leverage commonsense to resolve referential ambiguity in multi-turn conversations and analyze their behavior when ambiguity persists. Further, we study how requests for simplified language affect this capacity. Using a novel multilingual evaluation dataset, we test DeepSeek v3, GPT-4o, Qwen3-32B, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our findings indicate that current LLMs struggle to resolve ambiguity effectively: they tend to commit to a single interpretation or cover all possible references, rather than hedging or seeking clarification. This limitation becomes more pronounced under simplification prompts, which drastically reduce the use of commonsense reasoning and diverse response strategies. Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B with Direct Preference Optimization substantially improves ambiguity resolution across all request types. These results underscore the need for advanced fine-tuning to improve LLMs' handling of ambiguity and to ensure robust performance across diverse communication styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UncertaiNLP workshop @ EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.</p></details> |  |

While prior efforts have incorporated modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

There have been considerable attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.</p></details> |  |

Prior KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels. We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.</p></details> |  |

These models typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones. However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study, we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation set.

Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP> tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the <ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

These errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL) and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions. First, we study how each methods performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as: Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon, Adel Daoud, Connor T.

Their training relies heavily on the collection of vast amounts of data, which may include copyright-protected or sensitive information. Recent studies on detecting pretraining data in LLMs have primarily focused on sentence- or paragraph-level membership inference attacks (MIAs), usually involving probability analysis of the target model's predicted tokens. However, these methods often exhibit poor accuracy, failing to account for the semantic importance of textual content and word significance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Tag&Tab, a novel approach for detecting data used in LLM pretraining. Our method leverages established natural language processing (NLP) techniques to tag keywords in the input text, a process we term Tagging. Then, the LLM is used to obtain probabilities for these keywords and calculate their average log-likelihood to determine input text membership, a process we refer to as Tabbing. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets (BookMIA, MIMIR, PatentMIA, and the Pile) and several open-source LLMs of varying sizes demonstrate an average increase in AUC scores ranging from 5.3% to 17.6% over state-of-the-art methods. Tag&Tab not only sets a new standard for data leakage detection in LLMs, but its outstanding performance is a testament to the importance of words in MIAs on LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique: for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, direct application of LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Think-Verbalize-Speak, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is verbalizing, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We also introduce ReVerT, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on reasoning.

This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.</p></details> | AIES 2025 |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of LLM training across diverse real-world workloads and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA H100/H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs. We analyze dense and sparse models under various parallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate their effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation recomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that performance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up systems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in communication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in other cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show that certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to bandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing microbatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power excursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training performance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system topology, and model execution. We conclude by offering recommendations for system and hardware design to improve the scalability and reliability of future LLM systems and workloads.

We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as a proxy for successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be extended to thousands of languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

A key characteristic of these contexts is that activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover, despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision agriculture scenario.</p></details> |  |

Through controlled fine-tuning experiments across 132 translation directions, we systematically resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and -- surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with greater diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23386v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks. However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining. Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEFT: Bias-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15974v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning all-bias-terms stands out among various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, owing to its out-of-the-box usability and competitive performance, especially in low-data regimes. Bias-only fine-tuning has the potential for unprecedented parameter efficiency. However, the link between fine-tuning different bias terms (i.e., bias terms in the query, key, or value projections) and downstream performance remains unclear. The existing approaches, e.g., based on the magnitude of bias change or empirical Fisher information, provide limited guidance for selecting the particular bias term for effective fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose an approach for selecting the bias term to be fine-tuned, forming the foundation of our bias-efficient fine-tuning (BEFT). We extensively evaluate our bias-efficient approach against other bias-selection approaches, across a wide range of large language models (LLMs) spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures from 110M to 6.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our bias-efficient approach on diverse downstream tasks, including classification, multiple-choice, and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools. Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting. Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was measured. Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools. Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding the context window. Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation, and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of generative AI into clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Thus, companies continuously build large-scale GPU clusters, and launch training jobs that span over thousands of computing nodes. However, LLM pre-training presents unique challenges due to its complex communication patterns, where GPUs exchange data in sparse yet high-volume bursts within specific groups. Inefficient resource scheduling exacerbates bandwidth contention, leading to suboptimal training performance. This paper presents Arnold, a scheduling system summarizing our experience to effectively align LLM communication patterns with data center topology at scale. An in-depth characteristic study is performed to identify the impact of physical network topology to LLM pre-training jobs. Based on the insights, we develop a scheduling algorithm to effectively align communication patterns with the physical network topology in modern data centers. Through simulation experiments, we show the effectiveness of our algorithm in reducing the maximum spread of communication groups by up to $1.67$x. In production training, our scheduling system improves the end-to-end performance by $10.6\%$ when training with more than $9600$ GPUs, a significant improvement for our training pipeline.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems.</p></details> | under review |
| **[The Alignment Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15932v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity $\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity. Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities, consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity, manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> |  |

A principal obstacle is that most models output a single score without any accompanying measure of confidence or explanation. We address this gap with conformal prediction, a distribution-free wrapper that equips any classifier with set-valued outputs and formal coverage guarantees. Two open-source large language models (Llama-3 8B and Qwen-2.5 3B) are fine-tuned on three diverse corpora (ASAP, TOEFL11, Cambridge-FCE) and calibrated at a 90 percent risk level. Reliability is assessed with UAcc, an uncertainty-aware accuracy that rewards models for being both correct and concise. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine conformal prediction and UAcc for essay scoring. The calibrated models consistently meet the coverage target while keeping prediction sets compact, indicating that open-source, mid-sized LLMs can already support teacher-in-the-loop AES; we discuss scaling and broader user studies as future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference).

Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new "search-and-refine-during-think" paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents (FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings with partial observability and stochastic elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures.

However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

We present FRAME, a modular pipeline that reframes summarization as a semantic enrichment task. FRAME extracts and scores salient facts, organizes them thematically, and uses these to enrich an outline into an abstractive summary. To personalize summaries, we introduce SCOPE, a reason-out-loud protocol that has the model build a reasoning trace by answering nine questions before content selection. For evaluation, we propose P-MESA, a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework to assess if a summary fits a target reader. P-MESA reliably identifies error instances, achieving >= 89% balanced accuracy against human annotations and strongly aligns with human severity ratings (r >= 0.70). On QMSum and FAME, FRAME reduces hallucination and omission by 2 out of 5 points (measured with MESA), while SCOPE improves knowledge fit and goal alignment over prompt-only baselines. Our findings advocate for rethinking summarization to improve control, faithfulness, and personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distribution-Aligned Decoding for Efficient LLM Task Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15888v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVD thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |
| **[Creative Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14442v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across natural language generation tasks, their ability to generate truly creative content-characterized by novelty, diversity, surprise, and quality-remains limited. Existing methods for enhancing LLM creativity often focus narrowly on diversity or specific tasks, failing to address creativity's multifaceted nature in a generalizable way. In this work, we propose Creative Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of several models using CrPO and MuCE, a new large-scale human preference dataset spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30 psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines, including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising output quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at the main track of ACL 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how OCR-induced noise affects the performance of Multilingual QA Systems. To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR-induced errors and perform poorly on noisy OCR text. By comparing model performance on clean versus noisy texts, we provide insights into the limitations of current approaches and emphasize the need for more noise-resilient QA systems in historical digitization contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Role of Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15867v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping competitive programming. The field functions as an intellectual contest within computer science education and is marked by rapid iteration, real-time feedback, transparent solutions, and strict integrity norms. Prior work has evaluated LLMs performance on contest problems, but little is known about how human stakeholders -- contestants, problem setters, coaches, and platform stewards -- are adapting their workflows and contest norms under LLMs-induced shifts. At the same time, rising AI-assisted misuse and inconsistent governance expose urgent gaps in sustaining fairness and credibility. Drawing on 37 interviews spanning all four roles and a global survey of 207 contestants, we contribute: (i) an empirical account of evolving workflows, (ii) an analysis of contested fairness norms, and (iii) a chess-inspired governance approach with actionable measures -- real-time LLMs checks in online contests, peer co-monitoring and reporting, and cross-validation against offline performance -- to curb LLMs-assisted misuse while preserving fairness, transparency, and credibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15538v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).</p></details> |  |

However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages.

However, it is unclear whether LLMs accurately learn the underlying preferences in human feedback data. We coin the term \textit{Learned Feedback Pattern} (LFP) for patterns in an LLM's activations learned during RLHF that improve its performance on the fine-tuning task. We hypothesize that LLMs with LFPs accurately aligned to the fine-tuning feedback exhibit consistent activation patterns for outputs that would have received similar feedback during RLHF. To test this, we train probes to estimate the feedback signal implicit in the activations of a fine-tuned LLM. We then compare these estimates to the true feedback, measuring how accurate the LFPs are to the fine-tuning feedback. Our probes are trained on a condensed, sparse and interpretable representation of LLM activations, making it easier to correlate features of the input with our probe's predictions. We validate our probes by comparing the neural features they correlate with positive feedback inputs against the features GPT-4 describes and classifies as related to LFPs. Understanding LFPs can help minimize discrepancies between LLM behavior and training objectives, which is essential for the safety of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Beyond Linear Steering: Unified Multi-Attribute Control for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24535v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering, a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Interactive and Learnable Cooperative Driving Automation: a Large Language Model-Driven Decision-Making Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12812v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At present, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have begun to open road testing around the world, but their safety and efficiency performance in complex scenarios is still not satisfactory. Cooperative driving leverages the connectivity ability of CAVs to achieve synergies greater than the sum of their parts, making it a promising approach to improving CAV performance in complex scenarios. However, the lack of interaction and continuous learning ability limits current cooperative driving to single-scenario applications and specific Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework, to achieve all-scenario and all-CDA. First, since Large Language Models(LLMs) are not adept at handling mathematical calculations, an environment module is introduced to update vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, thus avoiding potential errors from direct LLM control of vehicle positions. Second, based on the four levels of CDA defined by the SAE J3216 standard, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (COT) based reasoning module that includes state perception, intent sharing, negotiation, and decision-making, enhancing the stability of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks. Centralized conflict resolution is then managed through a conflict coordinator in the reasoning process. Finally, by introducing a memory module and employing retrieval-augmented generation, CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences. We validate the proposed CoDrivingLLM through ablation experiments on the negotiation module, reasoning with different shots experience, and comparison with other cooperative driving methods.</p></details> |  |

Created through a multi-stage quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers, WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main).

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches integrating these encoders with LLM decoders improves transcription accuracy; however, it remains unclear whether these gains stem from visual understanding or stronger language modeling. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM decoders by freezing or selectively updating the visual encoder, scaling decoder size, comparing adaptation strategies and architectures, and varying training data across LRS2, LRS3, and their combination. Evaluation on LRS2, LRS3, and WildVSR shows that scaling and adaptation yield limited improvements, while combining datasets enhances generalization. Semantic analysis reveals that gains arise primarily from lexical rather than semantic processing. Our Llama-2-13B model trained on the combined set achieves 24.7\% WER on LRS3 and 47.0\% on WildVSR, establishing SOTA among models trained without additional supervision. Our findings indicate LLM decoders refine contextual reasoning rather than visual features, emphasizing the need for stronger visual encoders to drive meaningful progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have decided to withdraw the paper for further development</p></details> |

To address the challenges, we introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a versatile framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct pseudo-labels generated on in-the-wild data. In the LESS framework, pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and further improved by a data filtering strategy. Across Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST evaluations, LESS delivers consistent gains, with an absolute Word Error Rate reduction of 3.8% on WenetSpeech, and BLEU score increase of 0.8 and 0.7, achieving 34.0 on Callhome and 64.7 on Fisher testsets respectively. These results highlight LESS's effectiveness across diverse languages, tasks, and domains.

To investigate this question, we train a reward model to rank generated responses for a given question across languages. Our results show that our cross-lingual reward model substantially improves mathematical reasoning performance compared to using reward modeling within a single language, benefiting even high-resource languages. While English often exhibits the highest performance in multilingual models, we find that cross-lingual sampling particularly benefits English under low sampling budgets. Our findings reveal new opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning by leveraging the complementary strengths of diverse languages.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels, which enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under continuous improvement</p></details> |

An Empirical Analysis of Current Vulnerability Localization Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15777v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software vulnerability patch detection is a critical component for maintaining software security and ensuring software supply chain integrity. Traditional manual detection methods face significant scalability challenges when processing large volumes of commit histories, while being prone to human errors and omissions. Existing automated approaches, including heuristic-based methods and pre-trained model solutions, suffer from limited accuracy, poor generalization capabilities, and inherent methodological constraints that hinder their practical deployment. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification. Extensive experiments on a dataset containing 750 real vulnerabilities demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made progress in SER. However, MLLMs still suffer from hallucination and misclassification problems in complex emotion reasoning. To address these problems, we propose an MLLM-based framework called EmoQ, which generates query embeddings that fuse multimodal information through an EmoQ-Former and uses multi-objective affective learning (MAL) to achieve co-optimization. The framework also provides a soft-prompt injection strategy to inject multimodal representations into the LLM. This end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, providing a new multimodal fusion paradigm for SER.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

However, their application to machine translation (MT) remains underexplored due to the lack of systematic methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating, and deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla preference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically generating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for fine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model benchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling architectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures fine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our MT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level and sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs without additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in hypothesis ensembling.

While various compression strategies have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens (gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings. Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multi-view-guided Passage Reranking with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07485v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases. (1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking (MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

| **[On Optimal Steering to Achieve Exact Fairness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15759v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes. Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families (e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g., occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Judge Debates? Evaluating Non-Linear Reasoning via Argumentation Theory Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15739v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at linear reasoning tasks but remain underexplored on non-linear structures such as those found in natural debates, which are best expressed as argument graphs. We evaluate whether LLMs can approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory (CAT). Specifically, we use Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics, which assigns acceptability scores to arguments based on their attack and support relations. Given only dialogue-formatted debates from two NoDE datasets, models are prompted to rank arguments without access to the underlying graph. We test several LLMs under advanced instruction strategies, including Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning. While models show moderate alignment with QuAD rankings, performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow. Advanced prompting helps mitigate these effects by reducing biases related to argument length and position. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate future work on graph-aware reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[IGD: Token Decisiveness Modeling via Information Gain in LLMs for Personalized Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13229v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task. However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Most research focuses on training an adapter layer to generate a unified audio feature for the LLM. However, different tasks may require distinct features that emphasize either semantic or acoustic aspects, making task-specific audio features more desirable. In this paper, we propose Prompt-aware Mixture (PaM) to enhance the Speech LLM that uses multiple audio encoders. Our approach involves using different experts to extract different features based on the prompt that indicates different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that with PaM, only one Speech LLM surpasses the best performances achieved by all single-encoder Speech LLMs on ASR, Speaker Number Verification, and AC tasks. PaM also outperforms other feature fusion baselines, such as concatenation and averaging.

Previous research on fairness in opinion summarisation using large language models (LLMs) relied on hyperparameter tuning or providing ground truth distributional information in prompts. However, these methods face practical limitations: end-users rarely modify default model parameters, and accurate distributional information is often unavailable. Building upon cognitive science research demonstrating that frequency-based representations reduce systematic biases in human statistical reasoning by making reference classes explicit and reducing cognitive load, this study investigates whether frequency framed prompting (REFER) can similarly enhance fairness in LLM opinion summarisation. Through systematic experimentation with different prompting frameworks, we adapted techniques known to improve human reasoning to elicit more effective information processing in language models compared to abstract probabilistic representations.Our results demonstrate that REFER enhances fairness in language models when summarising opinions. This effect is particularly pronounced in larger language models and using stronger reasoning instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 5th New Frontiers in Summarization Workshop (NewSumm@EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Semantic Subdimensions through Disentangled Conceptual Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21436v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, large language models are typically trained with next-word prediction on massive amounts of text. Motivated by this contrast, we investigate whether language models can be trained with less data by learning not only from next-word prediction but also from high-level, cognitively inspired feedback. We train a student model to generate stories, which a teacher model rates on readability, narrative coherence, and creativity. By varying the amount of pretraining before the feedback loop, we assess the impact of this interactive learning on formal and functional linguistic competence. We find that the high-level feedback is highly data efficient: With just 1 M words of input in interactive learning, storytelling skills can improve as much as with 410 M words of next-word prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025, BabyLM Challenge; 16 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

More recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models, which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition. Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Most users lack specialized knowledge to specify detailed voice attributes, which often leads TTS systems to misinterpret their expectations. To address these gaps, we introduce Persona-to-Voice-Attribute (P2VA), the first framework enabling voice generation automatically from persona descriptions. Our approach employs two strategies: P2VA-C for structured voice attributes, and P2VA-O for richer style descriptions. Evaluation shows our P2VA-C reduces WER by 5% and improves MOS by 0.33 points. To the best of our knowledge, P2VA is the first framework to establish a connection between persona and voice synthesis. In addition, we discover that current LLMs embed societal biases in voice attributes during the conversion process. Our experiments and findings further provide insights into the challenges of building persona-voice systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Powered Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13452v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently approximate by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of analysis in real-world applications. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires enterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users. In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach that enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program analysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) subtasks. The core idea is to generalize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the LLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another (less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of AutoBug, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and language-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is challenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoBug can improve both the accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in "Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications" (OOPSLA), 2025</p></details> |

However, given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query? While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled, information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query. This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and (ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks, highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our method operates fully in continuous text representation spaces, fusing Whisper's hidden decoder states with those of an LLM through cross-modal attention, and supports both offline and streaming modes. We introduce \textit{VoxKrikri}, the first Greek speech LLM, and show through analysis that our approach effectively aligns representations across modalities. These results highlight continuous space fusion as a promising path for multilingual and low-resource speech LLMs, while achieving state-of-the-art results for Automatic Speech Recognition in Greek, providing an average $\sim20\%$ relative improvement across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |

However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12140v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.</p></details> |  |

With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.</p></details> |  |

However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d</p></details> |

The challenge focuses on developing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models that answer clinically relevant questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing interpretable justifications aligned with medical reasoning. It introduces two subtasks: (1) answering diverse types of visual questions using the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, and (2) generating multimodal explanations to support clinical decision-making. The Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, created from 6,500 images and 159,549 complex question-answer (QA) pairs, serves as the benchmark for the challenge.

| **[MedAtlas: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Round, Multi-Task Medical Reasoning Across Diverse Imaging Modalities and Clinical Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10947v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.26% and +26.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</p></details> | Corrected some typos |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables(2 in main, 4 in appendix)</p></details> |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCoT: Communication-Efficient Federated Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10020v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover, existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01450v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mihara-bot/DIQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2T-CoT: From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought for Medical Reasoning and Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19610v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal techniques have led to significant progress in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications.

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/keke-nice/MedTVT-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is critical in medicine, where identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50% using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using small-scale models of 8 billion parameters.

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o.

However, their practical deployment faces critical challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

| **[DoctorRAG: Medical RAG Fusing Knowledge with Patient Analogy through Textual Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19538v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Reasoning with Curriculum-Aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19213v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

A 3D Medical Benchmark for Tumor-centric Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18915v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark: https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 datasets&benchmarks track submission</p></details> |

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy. All resources are open-sourced to facilitate further research in medical reasoning MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[MediSee: Reasoning-based Pixel-level Perception in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11008v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception, existing methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on accurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[QM-ToT: A Medical Tree of Thoughts Reasoning Framework for Quantized Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12334v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[MedReason: Eliciting Factual Medical Reasoning Steps in LLMs via Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00993v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment planning require precise and complex reasoning, particularly in life-critical domains. Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

| **[GMAI-VL-R1: Harnessing Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01886v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in general medical AI have made significant strides, but existing models often lack the reasoning capabilities needed for complex medical decision-making. This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical reasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its reasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes decision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical support. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new evaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical reasoning models.

| **[m1: Unleash the Potential of Test-Time Scaling for Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00869v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |
| **[Medical Reasoning in LLMs: An In-Depth Analysis of DeepSeek R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00016v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 into healthcare requires rigorous evaluation of their reasoning alignment with clinical expertise. This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07459v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |

Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Problem-Solving Arising from Inflexible Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04381v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level accuracy on medical question-answer (QA) benchmarks. However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems.

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating background information and detailed guidance in addressing complex zero-shot Med-VQA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use. These findings reveal both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios and offer critical insights for medical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ENMLP-2024</p></details> |

In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

| **[Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |
| **[MedAgents: Large Language Models as Collaborators for Zero-shot Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10537v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance. Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, Under Review</p></details> |

However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05410v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |

For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases.

| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07285v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2021 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results in models with a clearer structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Preliminary Approach for Learning Relational Policies for the Management of Critically Ill Children](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04432v1)** | 2020-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased use of electronic health records has made possible the automated extraction of medical policies from patient records to aid in the development of clinical decision support systems. We adapted a boosted Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) framework to learn probabilistic rules from clinical hospital records for the management of physiologic parameters of children with severe cardiac or respiratory failure who were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this preliminary study, the results were promising. In particular, the algorithm returned logic rules for medical actions that are consistent with medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, presented at the 2020 AAAI StarAI workshop</p></details> |
| **[Resolving Conflicts in Clinical Guidelines using Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07526v1)** | 2019-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically reasoning with conflicting generic clinical guidelines is a burning issue in patient-centric medical reasoning where patient-specific conditions and goals need to be taken into account. It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at AAAMAS 2019</p></details> |
