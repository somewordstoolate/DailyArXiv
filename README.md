| **[Ready Jurist One: Benchmarking Language Agents for Legal Intelligence in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04037v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-Spear: A Conformity-Driven Prompt Injection Attack on Multi-Agent Debate Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13038v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems leverage collaborative interactions among large language models (LLMs) agents to improve reasoning capabilities. While recent studies have focused on increasing the accuracy and scalability of MAD systems, their security vulnerabilities have received limited attention. In this work, we introduce MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack that compromises a small subset of agents but significantly disrupts the overall MAD process. Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses, exploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade consensus quality. Furthermore, the attack can be composed with other strategies, such as communication attacks, to further amplify its impact by increasing the exposure of agents to incorrect responses. To assess MAD's resilience under attack, we propose a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that jointly considers accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear consistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance. Additionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work suggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance. These findings highlight the urgent need to improve the security in MAD design.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCPEval: Automatic MCP-based Deep Evaluation for AI Agent Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12806v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based intelligent agents underscores the need for robust, scalable evaluation frameworks. Existing methods rely on static benchmarks and labor-intensive data collection, limiting practical assessment. We introduce \oursystemname, an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP)-based framework that automates end-to-end task generation and deep evaluation of LLM agents across diverse domains. MCPEval standardizes metrics, seamlessly integrates with native agent tools, and eliminates manual effort in building evaluation pipelines. Empirical results across five real-world domains show its effectiveness in revealing nuanced, domain-specific performance. We publicly release MCPEval https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval to promote reproducible and standardized LLM agent evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval</p></details> |
| **[Infherno: End-to-end Agent-based FHIR Resource Synthesis from Free-form Clinical Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12261v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EMNLP 2025 System Demonstrations | Code: https://github.com/j-frei/Infherno | Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyj5C2ivbMw | Demo: https://infherno.misit-augsburg.de | HuggingFace Spaces: https://huggingface.co/spaces/nfel/infherno</p></details> |
| **[ReviewAgents: Bridging the Gap Between Human and AI-Generated Paper Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08506v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Value-Based Large Language Model Agent Simulation for Mutual Evaluation of Trust and Interpersonal Closeness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11979v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Literature and the Universe Via A Multi-Agent Large Language Model System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08958v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[General Modular Harness for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Gaming Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11633v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ICML MAS workshop</p></details> |
| **[DrafterBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Tasks Automation in Civil Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11527v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering. DrafterBench contains twelve types of tasks summarized from real-world drawing files, with 46 customized functions/tools and 1920 tasks in total. DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark to rigorously test AI agents' proficiency in interpreting intricate and long-context instructions, leveraging prior knowledge, and adapting to dynamic instruction quality via implicit policy awareness. The toolkit comprehensively assesses distinct capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning. DrafterBench offers detailed analysis of task accuracy and error statistics, aiming to provide deeper insight into agent capabilities and identify improvement targets for integrating LLMs in engineering applications. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench, with the test set hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eason666/DrafterBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench</p></details> |
| **[Assistance or Disruption? Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr.Copilot: A Multi-Agent Prompt Optimized Assistant for Improving Patient-Doctor Communication in Romanian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11299v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based telemedicine has become increasingly common, yet the quality of medical advice in doctor-patient interactions is often judged more on how advice is communicated rather than its clinical accuracy. To address this, we introduce Dr.Copilot , a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that supports Romanian-speaking doctors by evaluating and enhancing the presentation quality of their written responses. Rather than assessing medical correctness, Dr.Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises of three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform. Empirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable improvements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first real-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures, 2 tables, 2 listings</p></details> |
| **[SocioVerse: A World Model for Social Simulation Powered by LLM Agents and A Pool of 10 Million Real-World Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10157v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social simulation is transforming traditional social science research by modeling human behavior through interactions between virtual individuals and their environments. With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this approach has shown growing potential in capturing individual differences and predicting group behaviors. However, existing methods face alignment challenges related to the environment, target users, interaction mechanisms, and behavioral patterns. To this end, we introduce SocioVerse, an LLM-agent-driven world model for social simulation. Our framework features four powerful alignment components and a user pool of 10 million real individuals. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted large-scale simulation experiments across three distinct domains: politics, news, and economics. Results demonstrate that SocioVerse can reflect large-scale population dynamics while ensuring diversity, credibility, and representativeness through standardized procedures and minimal manual adjustments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temperature and Persona Shape LLM Agent Consensus With Minimal Accuracy Gains in Qualitative Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11198v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas (including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs, higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was 0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and experimentation code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted for review</p></details> |

Plancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the Minecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as a handcrafted planner and Oracle Retriever, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and compare their performance and efficiency to a handcrafted planner. Overall, we find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeking to Collide: Online Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving with Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00972v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lessons Learned from Evaluation of LLM based Multi-agents in Safer Therapy Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10911v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Multi-Modal LLM Agents for Treatment Planning in Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21418v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery (FUAS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality, valued for its safety and precision. Nevertheless, its clinical implementation entails intricate tasks such as multimodal image interpretation, personalized dose planning, and real-time intraoperative decision-making processes that demand intelligent assistance to improve efficiency and reliability. We introduce FUAS-Agents, an autonomous agent system that leverages the multimodal understanding and tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By integrating patient profiles and MRI data, FUAS-Agents orchestrates a suite of specialized medical AI tools, including segmentation, treatment dose prediction, and clinical guideline retrieval, to generate personalized treatment plans comprising MRI image, dose parameters, and therapeutic strategies. We evaluate the system in a uterine fibroid treatment scenario. Human assessment by four senior FUAS experts indicates that 82.5%, 82.5%, 87.5%, and 97.5% of the generated plans were rated 4 or above (on a 5-point scale) in terms of completeness, accuracy, fluency, and clinical compliance, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven agents in enhancing decision-making across complex clinical workflows, and exemplify a translational paradigm that combines general-purpose models with specialized expert systems to solve practical challenges in vertical healthcare domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. In this work, we argue this property imposes fundamental limitations on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems, precisely because they operate within natural language itself. Using Kolmogorov complexity, we demonstrate that as an expression's complexity grows, the amount of contextual information required to reliably resolve its ambiguity explodes combinatorially. The computational intractability of recovering a single intended meaning for complex or ambiguous text therefore suggests that the classical view that linguistic forms possess intrinsic meaning in and of themselves is conceptually inadequate. We argue instead that meaning is dynamically actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act, a process whose non-deterministic nature is most appropriately described by a non-classical, quantum-like logic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents. Our experiments yielded average CHSH expectation values from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs producing values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) in significant violation of the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$), demonstrating that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted submission to Quantum AI and NLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Warehouse Spatial Question Answering with LLM Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10778v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given complicated spatial question.

| **[Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game Theory Meets LLM and Agentic AI: Reimagining Cybersecurity for the Age of Intelligent Threats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10621v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect remains between theory and practical implementation. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset. This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic, Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent, and adaptive cyber systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negotiating Comfort: Simulating Personality-Driven LLM Agents in Shared Residential Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09657v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to simulate a social network in a shared residential building, driving the temperature decisions for a central heating system. Agents, divided into Family Members and Representatives, consider personal preferences, personal traits, connections, and weather conditions. Daily simulations involve family-level consensus followed by building-wide decisions among representatives. We tested three personality traits distributions (positive, mixed, and negative) and found that positive traits correlate with higher happiness and stronger friendships. Temperature preferences, assertiveness, and selflessness have a significant impact on happiness and decisions. This work demonstrates how LLM-driven agents can help simulate nuanced human behavior where complex real-life human simulations are difficult to set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs on Sequential API Call Through Automated Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09481v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen, an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current LLMs incorporating APIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agents Are the Antidote to Walled Gardens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23978v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.</p></details> |  |

Although extensive historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information. This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data? To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent.

| **[SetupBench: Assessing Software Engineering Agents' Ability to Bootstrap Development Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09063v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise end to end assistance with real-world software tasks, yet existing benchmarks evaluate LLM agents almost exclusively in pre-baked environments where every dependency is pre-installed. To fill this gap, we introduce SetupBench, a 93 instance benchmark that isolates the environment-bootstrap skill: starting from a bare Linux sandbox, an agent must install packages, resolve dependency conflicts, initialize databases, and configure background services. Our tasks span seven language ecosystems, five database engines, and multi-service orchestration scenarios, each accompanies by a natural language problem statement and a deterministic success command. Through evaluation of OpenHands, a state-of-the-art coding agent, we find low success rates across task categories, with particular challenges in repository setup (38.9-57.4%) and local database configuration (20.0-53.3%). Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes including incomplete development tooling installation, hallucinated task constraints, and non-persistent environment modifications that break agent-human collaboration workflows. We identify substantial inefficiencies in agent exploration strategies, with 38-89% of actions being unnecessary compared to optimal human behavior. These findings highlight gaps in current agents' practical environment-bootstrap capabilities. By targeting this critical yet under-evaluated capability, SetupBench provides a rigorous yard-stick for the next generation of software developer agents aiming to solve end to end real-wold tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Sequential Multi-Step Tasks with Parallel LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08944v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths. By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging, M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on MAS</p></details> |

| **[Text2BIM: Generating Building Models Using a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08054v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

| **[The Dark Side of LLMs Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.</p></details> |  |

However, as industries evolve, traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2nd Workshop on Financial Information Retrieval in the Era of Generative AI, The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval July 13-17, 2025 | Padua, Italy</p></details> |

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a high-level safety principle when faced with conflicting task instructions. Our evaluation of six LLMs reveals two primary findings: (1) a quantifiable "cost of compliance" where safety constraints degrade task performance even when compliant solutions exist, and (2) an "illusion of compliance" where high adherence often masks task incompetence rather than principled choice. These findings provide initial evidence that while LLMs can be influenced by hierarchical directives, current approaches lack the consistency required for reliable safety governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[The Future is Agentic: Definitions, Perspectives, and Open Challenges of Multi-Agent Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02097v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of recommender systems. We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration. We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance. For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters optimization approaches for Warm-Start Particles Swarm Optimization with Crossover and Mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algorithm, designed for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication, are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and improvable performance. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first set up via a profile, which specifies the boundary of hyper-parameters, task objective, terminal condition, conservative or aggressive strategy of optimizing hyper-parameters, and LLM configurations. Then, the LLM agent iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent exits the loop based on the terminal condition and returns an optimized set of hyperparameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO and WS-PSO-CM algorithm knowledge is useful in seeking high-performance hyper-parameters.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvestAlign: Overcoming Data Scarcity in Aligning Large Language Models with Investor Decision-Making Processes under Herd Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06528v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior.

| **[SHADE-Arena: Evaluating Sabotage and Monitoring in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15740v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging AI and Software Security: A Comparative Vulnerability Assessment of LLM Agent Deployment Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06323v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment.

| **[Too Human to Model:The Uncanny Valley of LLMs in Social Simulation -- When Generative Language Agents Misalign with Modelling Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06310v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents Are All You Need for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00406v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

Research on improving their accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and collaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method: We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various domains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE classification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE classification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving LLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE applications.</p></details> |  |

ECom-Bench features dynamic user simulation based on persona information collected from real e-commerce customer interactions and a realistic task dataset derived from authentic e-commerce dialogues. These tasks, covering a wide range of business scenarios, are designed to reflect real-world complexities, making ECom-Bench highly challenging. For instance, even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only a 10-20% pass^3 metric in our benchmark, highlighting the substantial difficulties posed by complex e-commerce scenarios. Upon publication, the code and data will be open-sourced to facilitate further research and development in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs are Introvert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05638v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods, including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes, emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains.

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Y.

However, their capabilities remain constrained in complex, multimodal scenarios. We present MindFlow, the first open-source multimodal LLM agent tailored for e-commerce. Built on the CoALA framework, it integrates memory, decision-making, and action modules, and adopts a modular "MLLM-as-Tool" strategy for effect visual-textual reasoning.

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Personalized Multi-Turn Dialogue with Curiosity Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03206v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI. Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future urban environments.</p></details> |  |

LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

Existing works rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own") KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers, reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.</p></details> |  |

This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment, focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a framework of gamified personality assessment through multi-personality representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models to empower virtual agents with diverse personalities. These agents elicit multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the interaction, it achieves two ways of personality assessments (i.e., Direct Assessment and Que-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights. Grounded in the classic Big Five theory, we implemented a prototype system and conducted a user study to assess the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance when considering the multiplicity of personality representation.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM models are usually fine-tuned on simple QA tasks and cannot comprehensively analyze real financial scenarios. Given the complexity, financial companies often distribute tasks among departments. Inspired by this, we propose FinTeam, a financial multi-agent collaborative system, with a workflow with four LLM agents: document analyzer, analyst, accountant, and consultant. We train these agents with specific financial expertise using constructed datasets. We evaluate FinTeam on comprehensive financial tasks constructed from real online investment forums, including macroeconomic, industry, and company analysis. The human evaluation shows that by combining agents, the financial reports generate from FinTeam achieved a 62.00% acceptance rate, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o and Xuanyuan. Additionally, FinTeam's agents demonstrate a 7.43% average improvement on FinCUGE and a 2.06% accuracy boost on FinEval.

| **[CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Existing approaches rely on heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise, they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation. To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework. Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate translations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Demo Track</p></details> |

Among these, LLM email agent apps represent one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources, allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness. To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all 1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops to as few as 1.23.</p></details> |  |

However, in the realm of video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US) Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10 on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\% higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.</p></details> |  |

We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM) decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of traditional intrinsic metrics.</p></details> |  |

As these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments, we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model, and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.</p></details> |  |

While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.</p></details> |  |

CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings, Source code: https://github.com/HahmDY/causal_influence_prompting.git</p></details> |

Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows, encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban intelligence.

Leveraging 21 million interactions on X during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on 1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini, Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative simulations, and policy modeling.</p></details> |  |

While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACL 2025 SRW</p></details> |

Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation, focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns. Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print version - paper actually under submission</p></details> |
| **[Corrupted by Reasoning: Reasoning Language Models Become Free-Riders in Public Goods Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23276v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

| **[From Prompt Injections to Protocol Exploits: Threats in LLM-Powered AI Agents Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23260v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration. Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains: Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies), System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[MetaSynth: Meta-Prompting-Driven Agentic Scaffolds for Diverse Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12563v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora. Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 17 figures.

| **[RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition, there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability. RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions. RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[L2MAC: Large Language Model Automatic Computer for Extensive Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02003v6)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed context window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their ability to produce long and coherent outputs. Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann architecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and consistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We empirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming other coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show that L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as writing an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's performance improvement over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

| **[Automated detection of atomicity violations in large-scale systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00521v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs pose a significant threat to software safety in critical systems. These violations occur when the execution sequence of operations on shared resources is disrupted by asynchronous interrupts. Detecting atomicity violations is challenging due to the vast program state space, application-level code dependencies, and complex domain-specific knowledge. We propose Clover, a hybrid framework that integrates static analysis with large language model (LLM) agents to detect atomicity violations in real-world programs. Clover first performs static analysis to extract critical code snippets and operation information. It then initiates a multi-agent process, where the expert agent leverages domain-specific knowledge to detect atomicity violations, which are subsequently validated by the judge agent. Evaluations on RaceBench 2.1, SV-COMP, and RWIP demonstrate that Clover achieves a precision/recall of 92.3%/86.6%, outperforming existing approaches by 27.4-118.2% on F1-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design Patterns for Securing LLM Agents against Prompt Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Vulnerable than You Think: On the Stability of Tool-Integrated LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21967v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Powered Agent for C to Rust Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15858v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The C programming language has been foundational in building system-level software. However, its manual memory management model frequently leads to memory safety issues. In response, a modern system programming language, Rust, has emerged as a memory-safe alternative. Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust translation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities of LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. Despite some success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs to static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic problem-solving capability. Applying the LLM agentic capability for the C-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from the traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains. First, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of suitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning. Second, unlike math or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not well-defined. Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these intermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory. To address these challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate step, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning framework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R). The VFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors between an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate informative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code. LAC2R uses the MCTS to systematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct translation. We experimentally demonstrated that LAC2R effectively conducts C-to-Rust translation on large-scale, real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doppelganger Method: Breaking Role Consistency in LLM Agent via Prompt-based Transferable Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14539v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelganger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelganger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelganger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20921v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (main manuscript without references), 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Poster: Enhancing GNN Robustness for Network Intrusion Detection via Agent-based Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20806v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Poste...</summary><p>Poster accepted at the 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of AI for Materials Science: Foundation Models, LLM Agents, Datasets, and Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20743v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios. These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering of LLMs, for the Creation of Multi-Agent AI for Addressing Sustainable Protein Production Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20598v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzz-Testing Meets LLM-Based Agents: An Automated and Efficient Framework for Jailbreaking Text-To-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer.</p></details> |  |

However, joint evolution across heterogeneous agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities. Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commander-GPT: Dividing and Routing for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19420v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander (e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models, serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and 11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defeating Prompt Injections by Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an untrusted environment. However, LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks when handling untrusted data. In this paper we propose CaMeL, a robust defense that creates a protective system layer around the LLM, securing it even when underlying models are susceptible to attacks. To operate, CaMeL explicitly extracts the control and data flows from the (trusted) query; therefore, the untrusted data retrieved by the LLM can never impact the program flow. To further improve security, CaMeL uses a notion of a capability to prevent the exfiltration of private data over unauthorized data flows by enforcing security policies when tools are called. We demonstrate effectiveness of CaMeL by solving $77\%$ of tasks with provable security (compared to $84\%$ with an undefended system) in AgentDojo. We release CaMeL at https://github.com/google-research/camel-prompt-injection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with newer models and link to the code</p></details> |

We introduce MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools, MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth. This work establishes active tool discovery as a fundamental design pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems.</p></details> |  |

This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the data curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances. To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation. We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces AgenticControl, a novel multi-agent framework that automates controller design using coordinated Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Through structured JSON communication, these agents handle tasks including controller selection, scenario design, parameter optimization, performance evaluation, and decision-making. Through an actor-critic optimization approach, the system iteratively improves performance while progressing through scenarios of increasing complexity to ensure robustness under nominal conditions, measurement noise, actuator disturbances, and parametric uncertainties. Key innovations include structured multi-agent collaboration, robust optimization mechanisms, and real-time adaptability via in-context learning. Validated across four diverse control systems, namely, DC Motor Position control, Ball and Beam, Inverted Pendulum, and Double Inverted Pendulum, the framework achieves competitive performance against classical methods. Its Full State Feedback solution closely matches Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) results, while the designed PID controller significantly outperforming MATLAB's PIDTuner, reducing PID tracking error by 55% through adaptive parameter exploration. A comparative study of five LLM models reveals distinct optimization profiles, with DeepSeek achieving the fastest convergence. This work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven control design, paving the way for advanced techniques like model predictive control and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 10 pages,3 figures |

This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment.

Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17163v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeVisE: Behavioral Testing of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15339v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRD-RAG: Enhancing Medical Diagnosis with Multi-Round Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a significant trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention due to its features of rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, existing medical RAG frameworks still have shortcomings. Most existing medical RAG frameworks are designed for single-round question answering tasks and are not suitable for multi-round diagnostic dialogue. On the other hand, existing medical multi-round RAG frameworks do not consider the interconnections between potential diseases to inquire precisely like a doctor. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the doctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis information of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis like a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we conduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese medicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different methods. The results indicate that our RAG framework can significantly enhance the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of our approach in medical diagnosis. The code and data can be found in our project website https://github.com/YixiangCh/MRD-RAG/tree/master.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios.

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |
| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Medical Large Language Models through Cross-Domain Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00832v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in natural language processing, particularly in specialized domains like healthcare. In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks. Secondly, the wide-ranging applications of Med-LLMs are investigated across various healthcare domains, as well as an up-to-date review of existing Med-LLMs. The transformative impact of these models on daily medical practice is evident through their ability to assist clinicians, educators, and patients. Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo.

The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field.

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models.

However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge. These findings elucidate both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs within the context of MedBench, with the ultimate goal of aiding the medical research community.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI-24 |

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

In this work, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly simple joke forms.</p></details> |  |

This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ongoi...</summary><p>ongoing work; 165 pages, 1401 citations</p></details> |
| **[The Imitation Game: Turing Machine Imitator is Length Generalizable Reasoner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13332v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented as a poster at MMFM 2025</p></details> |

Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper 12 pages, Appendix 7 pages, 1 figure, 18 tables</p></details> |

These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/wazenmai/HC-SMoE</p></details> |
| **[The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use.</p></details> |  |

AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, the adoption and progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which have so far been unavailable in this domain. To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish, German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English. Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions. The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered the evaluation of gender bias. TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language technologies for the labor market.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working in progress. 22 pages (8+ for main); 25 figures; 1 table</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Cross-task Transfer of Large Language Models via Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13236v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements challenge programming skills, ethics, and assessment integrity, making the detection of LLM-generated code essential for maintaining accountability and standards. While, there has been some research on this problem, it generally lacks domain coverage and robustness, and only covers a small number of programming languages. To this end, we propose a framework capable of distinguishing between human- and LLM-written code across multiple programming languages, code generators, and domains. We use a large-scale dataset from renowned platforms and LLM-based code generators, alongside applying rigorous data quality checks, feature engineering, and comparative analysis using evaluation of traditional machine learning models, pre-trained language models (PLMs), and LLMs for code detection. We perform an evaluation on out-of-domain scenarios, such as detecting the authorship and hybrid authorship of generated code and generalizing to unseen models, domains, and programming languages. Moreover, our extensive experiments show that our framework effectively distinguishes human- from LLM-written code and sets a new benchmark for this task.</p></details> |  |

The test consists of various tasks aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at KES 2025.

However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SLaTE 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Scenario-Profiled Indexing with Knowledge Expansion (SPIKE), a dense retrieval framework that explicitly indexes implicit relevance by decomposing documents into scenario-based retrieval units. SPIKE organizes documents into scenario, which encapsulates the reasoning process necessary to uncover implicit relationships between hypothetical information needs and document content. SPIKE constructs a scenario-augmented dataset using a powerful teacher large language model (LLM), then distills these reasoning capabilities into a smaller, efficient scenario generator. During inference, SPIKE incorporates scenario-level relevance alongside document-level relevance, enabling reasoning-aware retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPIKE consistently enhances retrieval performance across various query types and dense retrievers. It also enhances the retrieval experience for users through scenario and offers valuable contextual information for LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Dual-Level Multi-Interest Modeling for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10917v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests. Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions, allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34 participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such technologies in complex, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages.

The recent success of reasoning models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and IRL techniques.</p></details> |  |

These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.</p></details> |  |

Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Recent studies have uncovered severe data contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches involve direct solution leakage and 31.08% pass due to inadequate test cases. We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300 samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models.

Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 44.71\% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments. Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.</p></details> |  |

The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health), highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL SRW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Human Demonstrations are Generalizable Knowledge for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02419v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human demonstrations is an emerging trend for designing intelligent robotic systems. However, previous methods typically regard videos as instructions, simply dividing them into action sequences for robotic repetition, which poses obstacles to generalization to diverse tasks or object instances. In this paper, we propose a different perspective, considering human demonstration videos not as mere instructions, but as a source of knowledge for robots. Motivated by this perspective and the remarkable comprehension and generalization capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), we propose DigKnow, a method that DIstills Generalizable KNOWledge with a hierarchical structure. Specifically, DigKnow begins by converting human demonstration video frames into observation knowledge. This knowledge is then subjected to analysis to extract human action knowledge and further distilled into pattern knowledge compassing task and object instances, resulting in the acquisition of generalizable knowledge with a hierarchical structure. In settings with different tasks or object instances, DigKnow retrieves relevant knowledge for the current task and object instances. Subsequently, the LLM-based planner conducts planning based on the retrieved knowledge, and the policy executes actions in line with the plan to achieve the designated task. Utilizing the retrieved knowledge, we validate and rectify planning and execution outcomes, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the success rate. Experimental results across a range of tasks and scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating real-world robots to accomplish tasks with the knowledge derived from human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in lEEE/RSJ international Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (lROS 2025)</p></details> |

While existing research primarily focuses on either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency, clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

While recent studies have focused on increasing the accuracy and scalability of MAD systems, their security vulnerabilities have received limited attention. In this work, we introduce MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack that compromises a small subset of agents but significantly disrupts the overall MAD process. Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses, exploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade consensus quality. Furthermore, the attack can be composed with other strategies, such as communication attacks, to further amplify its impact by increasing the exposure of agents to incorrect responses. To assess MAD's resilience under attack, we propose a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that jointly considers accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear consistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance. Additionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work suggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance. These findings highlight the urgent need to improve the security in MAD design.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided.

We present LLM2Fx, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict Fx parameters directly from textual descriptions without requiring task-specific training or fine-tuning. Our approach address the text-to-effect parameter prediction (Text2Fx) task by mapping natural language descriptions to the corresponding Fx parameters for equalization and reverberation. We demonstrate that LLMs can generate Fx parameters in a zero-shot manner that elucidates the relationship between timbre semantics and audio effects in music production. To enhance performance, we introduce three types of in-context examples: audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) features, DSP function code, and few-shot examples. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based Fx parameter generation outperforms previous optimization approaches, offering competitive performance in translating natural language descriptions to appropriate Fx settings. Furthermore, LLMs can serve as text-driven interfaces for audio production, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible music production tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)</p></details> |

SLU encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA). However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity, limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and models at github to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency.

Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).</p></details> |  |
| **[OASIS: Order-Augmented Strategy for Improved Code Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08161v4)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</p></details> |  |

However, interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning, along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.</p></details> | <details><summary>It is...</summary><p>It is accepted by 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS2025</p></details> |

However, high-quality vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

It has been demonstrated that distilling high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from advanced general reasoning models offers a promising and efficient path to the financial reasoning model. However, existing CoT synthesis methods suffer from shallow CoT sampling, leaving the question of how to construct a well-designed knowledge space for finance reasoning unexplored. In this paper, we present \textbf{Agentar-DeepFinance-300K }, a large-scale financial reasoning dataset characterized by its systematic CoT synthesis optimization. We first introduce a comprehensive CoT synthesis pipeline featuring Multi-perspective Knowledge Extraction (MKE) and Self-Corrective Rewriting (SCR) to generate exhaustive and deep financial reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, a systematic investigation, termed CoT Cube, is conducted to analyze critical factors that influence CoT effectiveness, such as necessity, length and synthesizer, yielding valuable insights for high-quality financial CoT construction. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on our Agentar-DeepFinance-300K achieve significant improvements on financial benchmarks. We publicly release Agentar-DeepFinance-300K , hoping to advance the research in financial reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (Gemma-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and LLaMA-2-13B). We acquired the top 10 most popular books of a month, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and prompted each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks per book for human evaluation, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95%. The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.724, 0.263, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also show that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of Wikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform error analyses of predictions. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted for presentation by Recent Advances in NLP (RANLP) 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously, remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.</p></details> |  |

Large language models, representing a textual generative perspective, excel at modeling user languages, understanding behavioral contexts, capturing user-item semantic relationships, analyzing textual sentiments, and generating coherent and contextually relevant texts as recommendations. However, there is a gap between the connected graph perspective and the text generation perspective as the task formulations are different. A research question arises: how can we effectively integrate the two perspectives for more personalized recsys? To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity information of edges. Our evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data and to improve the relevance and quality of recommendation results.</p></details> |  |

Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.

A main reason for this success is the ability of LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently, employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm tasked with tabletop manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs) often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing 35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94).</p></details> |  |

The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Evalu...</summary><p>Evaluation Report. 85 pages, 30 Figures</p></details> |

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</p></details> |

However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.</p></details> |  |

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Gao19/DeQA-Doc.</p></details> |  |

Negation is an important semantic function that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on negation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, updated with new experimental results and implementation details</p></details> |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aime: Towards Fully-Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11988v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures, |

However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our model's zero-shot generation capability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE journals</p></details> |

However, its effective use in machine learning is often constrained by data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging generative models to learn underlying data distributions and produce realistic, privacy-preserving samples. Although this area has seen growing attention, most existing surveys focus narrowly on specific methods (e.g., GANs or privacy-enhancing techniques), lacking a unified and comprehensive view that integrates recent advances such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). In this survey, we present a structured and in-depth review of synthetic tabular data generation methods. Specifically, the survey is organized into three core components: (1) Background, which covers the overall generation pipeline, including problem definitions, synthetic tabular data generation methods, post processing, and evaluation; (2) Generation Methods, where we categorize existing approaches into traditional generation methods, diffusion model methods, and LLM-based methods, and compare them in terms of architecture, generation quality, and applicability; and (3) Applications and Challenges, which summarizes practical use cases, highlights common datasets, and discusses open challenges such as heterogeneity, data fidelity, and privacy protection. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a holistic understanding of the field and to highlight key directions for future work in synthetic tabular data generation.</p></details> |  |

While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention, another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up, considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped object queries. We provide our code and dataset at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/osmAG-LLM.</p></details> |  |

We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.</p></details> |  |

Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/tanyuqian/synthetic-private-data</p></details> |

Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases. Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages), and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of 3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49% of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone questions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-hallu-detect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Drug Identification in Overdose Death Surveillance using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12679v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in 2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024. Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10 coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, 2 supplemental figures, 4 supplemental tables, submitted to Journal of Forensic Sciences (JFS)</p></details> |

We present ParaStudent, a systematic study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

In contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single, long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current practices.

This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Vaidehi99/UPCORE</p></details> |

Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</p></details> | Accepted to ICWSM'26 |

As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Cross-Layer Discrete Concept Discovery for Interpreting Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20040v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration.

As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone. In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9, 8 ...</summary><p>9, 8 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL Main 2025</p></details> |

In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |

On Bias Amplifications and Resistance in Multi-Agent Based LLM-as-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19477v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL** (**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/pspdada/SENTINEL.</p></details> |  |

While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 19 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications.

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning.

| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is critical in medicine, where identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50% using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using small-scale models of 8 billion parameters.

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</p></details> |  |

A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o.

However, their practical deployment faces critical challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based agents in medicine, examining their architectures, applications, and challenges. We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Reasoning with Curriculum-Aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19213v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

A 3D Medical Benchmark for Tumor-centric Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18915v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception.

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy.

| **[A Method for the Architecture of a Medical Vertical Large Language Model Based on Deepseek R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00025v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[MediSee: Reasoning-based Pixel-level Perception in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11008v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception, existing methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on accurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical reasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its reasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes decision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical support. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization.

However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |

This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |

Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset.

| **[MedS$^3$: Towards Medical Small Language Models with Self-Evolved Slow Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12051v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical language models (MLMs) have become pivotal in advancing medical natural language processing. However, prior models that rely on pre-training or supervised fine-tuning often exhibit low data efficiency and limited practicality in real-world clinical applications. While OpenAI's o1 highlights test-time scaling in mathematics, attempts to replicate this approach in medicine typically distill responses from GPT-series models to open-source models, focusing primarily on multiple-choice tasks. This strategy, though straightforward, neglects critical concerns like data privacy and realistic deployment in clinical settings. In this work, we present a deployable, small-scale medical reasoning system, MedS3, designed for long-chain reasoning in clinical tasks using a self-evolution paradigm. Starting with a seed dataset of around 8,000 instances spanning five domains and 16 datasets, we prompt a base policy model to perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct rule-verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the process reward model (PRM). During inference, the policy model generates multiple responses, and the reward model selects the one with a newly proposed PRM-guided Vote-Sum (P-VS) strategy. Experiments on eleven evaluation datasets demonstrate that MedS3 outperforms not only the prior strongest medical model by 6.59, but also 32B-level general reasoning models by 8.71 points.

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Problem-Solving Arising from Inflexible Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04381v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level accuracy on medical question-answer (QA) benchmarks. However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[HuatuoGPT-o1, Towards Medical Complex Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18925v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating background information and detailed guidance in addressing complex zero-shot Med-VQA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

| **[Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |

This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance.

However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the gap reaches a pronounced 18% in out-domain settings. Our findings suggest expert-knowledge reasoning in large language models can be elicited through proper promptings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Tiny Paper at ICLR 2023 (10 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05410v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

| **[Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375v2)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Classic-Quantum Computing for Staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of Breast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10142v1)** | 2023-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great current relevance of Artificial Intelligence, and the extraordinary innovations that this discipline has brought to many fields -among which, without a doubt, medicine is found-, experts in medical applications of Artificial Intelligence are looking for new alternatives to solve problems for which current Artificial Intelligence programs do not provide with optimal solutions. For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases. A detailed discussion is also provided at the end of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information (ISSN 2078-2489)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07285v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2021 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results in models with a clearer structure.</p></details> |  |

We adapted a boosted Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) framework to learn probabilistic rules from clinical hospital records for the management of physiologic parameters of children with severe cardiac or respiratory failure who were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this preliminary study, the results were promising. In particular, the algorithm returned logic rules for medical actions that are consistent with medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, presented at the 2020 AAAI StarAI workshop</p></details> |
| **[Resolving Conflicts in Clinical Guidelines using Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07526v1)** | 2019-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically reasoning with conflicting generic clinical guidelines is a burning issue in patient-centric medical reasoning where patient-specific conditions and goals need to be taken into account. It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at AAAMAS 2019</p></details> |
