| **[TVCACHE: A Stateful Tool-Value Cache for Post-Training LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10986v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In RL post-training of LLM agents, calls to external tools take several seconds or even minutes, leaving allocated GPUs idle and inflating post-training time and cost. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abhis...</summary><p>Abhishek Vijaya Kumar and Bhaskar Kataria have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[AgentCrypt: Advancing Privacy and (Secure) Computation in AI Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08104v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents increasingly operate in complex environments, ensuring reliable, context-aware privacy is critical for regulatory compliance. Traditional access controls are insufficient because privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may inadvertently compromise privacy during reasoning by messaging humans, leaking context to peers, or executing unsafe tool calls. Existing approaches typically treat privacy as a binary constraint, overlooking nuanced, computation-dependent requirements. Furthermore, Large Language Model (LLM) agents are inherently probabilistic, lacking formal guarantees for security-critical operations. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a three-tiered framework for secure agent communication that adds a deterministic protection layer atop any AI platform. AgentCrypt spans the full spectrum of privacy needs: from unrestricted data exchange (Level 1), to context-aware masking (Level 2), up to fully encrypted computation using Homomorphic Encryption (Level 3). Unlike prompt-based defenses, our approach guarantees that tagged data privacy is strictly preserved even when the underlying model errs. Security is decoupled from the agent's probabilistic reasoning, ensuring sensitive data remains protected throughout the computational lifecycle. AgentCrypt enables collaborative computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers like data silos. We implemented and validated it using LangGraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across architectures. Finally, we introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks to enable systematic evaluation and foster the development of trustworthy, regulatable machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locomo-Plus: Beyond-Factual Cognitive Memory Evaluation Framework for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10715v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term conversational memory is a core capability for LLM-based dialogue systems, yet existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols primarily focus on surface-level factual recall. In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks. Our code and evaluation framework are publicly available at: https://github.com/xjtuleeyf/Locomo-Plus.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ISD-Agent-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Instructional Design Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10620v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown promising potential in automating Instructional Systems Design (ISD), a systematic approach to developing educational programs. However, evaluating these agents remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and the risk of LLM-as-judge bias. We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment. Our work provides a foundation for systematic LLM-based ISD research.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Skills Lie: Hidden-Comment Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10498v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents often rely on Skills to describe available tools and recommended procedures. We study a hidden-comment prompt injection risk in this documentation layer: when a Markdown Skill is rendered to HTML, HTML comment blocks can become invisible to human reviewers, yet the raw text may still be supplied verbatim to the model. In experiments, we find that DeepSeek-V3.2 and GLM-4.5-Air can be influenced by malicious instructions embedded in a hidden comment appended to an otherwise legitimate Skill, yielding outputs that contain sensitive tool intentions. A short defensive system prompt that treats Skills as untrusted and forbids sensitive actions prevents these malicious tool calls and instead surfaces the suspicious hidden instructions.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[From Prompt-Response to Goal-Directed Systems: The Evolution of Agentic AI Software Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10479v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI denotes an architectural transition from stateless, prompt-driven generative models toward goal-directed systems capable of autonomous perception, planning, action, and adaptation through iterative control loops. This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy. The persistent challenges related to verifiability, interoperability, and safe autonomy remain key areas for future research and practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Belief Entrenchment to Robust Reasoning in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v5)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising inference scaling method for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. However, it frequently suffers from belief entrenchment, where agents reinforce shared errors rather than correcting them. Going beyond merely identifying this failure, we decompose it into two distinct root causes: (1) the model's biased $\textit{static initial belief}$ and (2) $\textit{homogenized debate dynamics}$ that amplify the majority view regardless of correctness. To address these sequentially, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$. Our framework first rectifies the static belief via strategic prior knowledge elicitation, then reshapes the debate dynamics by enforcing perspective diversity. Validated on our new $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$ benchmark, $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly mitigates entrenchment, achieving a +9.5\% accuracy gain over ReAct prompting and a +19.0\% higher win rate than standard MAD.</p></details> | Accepted to TACL |
| **[The Landscape of Prompt Injection Threats in LLM Agents: From Taxonomy to Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10453v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a paradigm shift towards autonomous agents, necessitating robust security against Prompt Injection (PI) vulnerabilities where untrusted inputs hijack agent behaviors. This SoK presents a comprehensive overview of the PI landscape, covering attacks, defenses, and their evaluation practices. Through a systematic literature review and quantitative analysis, we establish taxonomies that categorize PI attacks by payload generation strategies (heuristic vs. optimization) and defenses by intervention stages (text, model, and execution levels). Our analysis reveals a key limitation shared by many existing defenses and benchmarks: they largely overlook context-dependent tasks, in which agents are authorized to rely on runtime environmental observations to determine actions. To address this gap, we introduce AgentPI, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate agent behavior under context-dependent interaction settings. Using AgentPI, we empirically evaluate representative defenses and show that no single approach can simultaneously achieve high trustworthiness, high utility, and low latency. Moreover, we show that many defenses appear effective under existing benchmarks by suppressing contextual inputs, yet fail to generalize to realistic agent settings where context-dependent reasoning is essential. This SoK distills key takeaways and open research problems, offering structured guidance for future research and practical deployment of secure LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIvilization v0: Toward Large-Scale Artificial Social Simulation with a Unified Agent Architecture and Adaptive Agent Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10429v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIvilization v0 is a publicly deployed large-scale artificial society that couples a resource-constrained sandbox economy with a unified LLM-agent architecture, aiming to sustain long-horizon autonomy while remaining executable under rapidly changing environment. To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[KernelBand: Steering LLM-based Kernel Optimization via Hardware-Aware Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18868v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance GPU kernels are critical for efficient LLM serving, yet their optimization remains a bottleneck requiring deep system expertise. While code LLMs show promise in generating functionally correct code, kernel optimization is intrinsically a search problem over a vast optimization space. The fundamental mismatch prevents existing LLM agents from efficiently exploring the optimization space for diverse hardware and compute patterns. To bridge the gap, we present KernelBand, a framework that formulates kernel optimization as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, explicitly balancing exploration and exploitation to unlock the potential of code LLMs. To navigate the infinite arm space of optimization strategies applied to candidate kernels, we design two key mechanisms: a hardware-aware pruning strategy via profiling bounds and a trace-driven clustering algorithm that leverages Lipschitz continuity. Theoretically, we prove that KernelBand reduces the regret bound to depend on the compact covering number of runtime clusters, ensuring sample-efficient discovery of high-performance kernels. Extensive experiments on TritonBench-G with three GPU architectures and four code LLMs show that KernelBand consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 33% average improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 pages main text), 4 figures. v2: Full revision</p></details> |
| **[Self-Evolving Recommendation System: End-To-End Autonomous Model Optimization With LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10226v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems, such as recommendation models for global video platforms, requires navigating a massive hyperparameter search space and, more critically, designing sophisticated optimizers, architectures, and reward functions to capture nuanced user behaviors. Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artisan: Agentic Artifact Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10046v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact evaluation has become standard practice in the software engineering community to ensure the reproducibility of research results. However, the current manual process is labor-intensive, and hence, done only as a one-time assessment for a subset of all papers. To support the artifact evaluation effort, we present Artisan, an automated LLM agent for reproducing research results given a paper and its artifact. The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages. We validate all tasks in Artisan-Bench for reproducibility to ensure that the tasks are feasible. Our experiments show that Artisan is effective, producing 44/60 reproduction scripts and outperforming the best available baseline, a vanilla LLM agent (mini-swe-agent), by 3.14$\times$ in terms of reproduction scripts generated while taking $0.45 and 48 minutes, on average per task. Artisan also helped uncover 20 new errors in either the paper or artifact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Among Us: A Sandbox for Measuring and Detecting Agentic Deception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04072v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on deception in language-based AI agents typically assess whether the agent produces a false statement about a topic, or makes a binary choice prompted by a goal, rather than allowing open-ended deceptive behavior to emerge in pursuit of a longer-term goal. To fix this, we introduce Among Us, a sandbox social deception game where LLM-agents exhibit long-term, open-ended deception as a consequence of the game objectives. While most benchmarks saturate quickly, Among Us can be expected to last much longer, because it is a multi-player game far from equilibrium. Using the sandbox, we evaluate 18 proprietary and open-weight LLMs and uncover a general trend: models trained with RL are comparatively much better at producing deception than detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of methods to detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of "pretend you're a dishonest model:.." generalize extremely well out-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated just on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought. We also find two SAE features that work well at deception detection but are unable to steer the model to lie less. We hope our open-sourced sandbox, game logs, and probes serve to anticipate and mitigate deceptive behavior and capabilities in language-based agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, preprint |
| **[Why Do AI Agents Systematically Fail at Cloud Root Cause Analysis?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09937v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnalyticsGPT: An LLM Workflow for Scientometric Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09817v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task. Our (skeleton) code and prompts are available at: https://github.com/lyvykhang/llm-agents-scientometric-qa/tree/acl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tiny Moves: Game-based Hypothesis Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09801v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[MATA: Multi-Agent Framework for Reliable and Flexible Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09642v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cochain: Balancing Insufficient and Excessive Collaboration in LLM Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10936v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in executing complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought effectively enhances reasoning capabilities by unlocking the potential of large models, while multi-agent systems provide more comprehensive solutions by integrating the collective intelligence of multiple agents. However, both approaches face significant limitations. Single-agent with chain-of-thought, due to the inherent complexity of designing cross-domain prompts, faces collaboration challenges. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves the business workflow collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost. Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms GPT-4.</p></details> | 35 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Learning from the Irrecoverable: Error-Localized Policy Optimization for Tool-Integrated LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09598v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) enables LLM agents to solve tasks through planning, tool use, and iterative revision, but outcome-only reinforcement learning in this setting suffers from sparse, delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment. In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Jokeasy: Exploring Human-AI Collaboration in Thematic Joke Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09496v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thematic jokes are central to stand-up comedy, sitcoms, and public speaking, where contexts and punchlines rely on fresh material - news, anecdotes, and cultural references that resonate with the audience. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled interactive joke generation through conversational interfaces. Although LLMs enable interactive joke generation, ordinary conversational interfaces seldom give creators enough agency, control, or timely access to such source material for constructing context and punchlines. We designed Jokeasy, a search-enabled prototype system that integrates a dual-role LLM agent acting as both a material scout and a prototype writer to support human-AI collaboration in thematic joke writing. Jokeasy provides a visual canvas in which retrieved web content is organized into editable inspiration blocks and developed through a multistage workflow. A qualitative study with 13 hobbyists and 5 expert participants (including professional comedians and HCI/AI specialists) showed that weaving real-time web material into this structured workflow enriches ideation and preserves author agency, while also revealing needs for finer search control, tighter chat-canvas integration, and more flexible visual editing. These insights refine our understanding of AI-assisted humour writing and guide future creative-writing tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IASDR 2025.

| **[EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22576v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02424v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents. However, most existing methods struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED show ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%. The code is available at https://github.com/Choi-JaeWoo/ReAcTree.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Full Paper at AAMAS 2026.

| **[Test vs Mutant: Adversarial LLM Agents for Robust Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08146v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing is a critical, yet resource-intensive phase of the software development lifecycle. Over the years, various automated tools have been developed to aid in this process. Search-based approaches typically achieve high coverage but produce tests with low readability, whereas large language model (LLM)-based methods generate more human-readable tests but often suffer from low coverage and compilability. While the majority of research efforts have focused on improving test coverage and readability, little attention has been paid to enhancing the robustness of bug detection, particularly in exposing corner cases and vulnerable execution paths. To address this gap, we propose AdverTest, a novel adversarial framework for LLM-powered test case generation. AdverTest comprises two interacting agents: a test case generation agent (T) and a mutant generation agent (M). These agents engage in an adversarial loop, where M persistently creates new mutants "hacking" the blind spots of T's current test suite, while T iteratively refines its test cases to "kill" the challenging mutants produced by M. This interaction loop is guided by both coverage and mutation scores, enabling the system to co-evolve toward both high test coverage and bug detection capability. Experimental results in the Defects4J dataset show that our approach improves fault detection rates by 8.56% over the best existing LLM-based methods and by 63.30% over EvoSuite, while also improving line and branch coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Poincaré Shaping for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09375v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LaPha, a method for training AlphaZero-like LLM agents in a Poincaré latent space. Under LaPha, the search process can be visualized as a tree rooted at the prompt and growing outward from the origin toward the boundary of the Poincaré ball, where negative curvature provides exponentially increasing capacity with radius. Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25.</p></details> |  |

We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProAgentBench: Evaluating LLM Agents for Proactive Assistance with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04482v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive agents that anticipate user intentions without explicit prompts represent a significant evolution in human-AI interaction, promising to reduce cognitive load and streamline workflows. However, existing datasets suffer from two critical deficiencies: (1) reliance on LLM-synthesized data that fails to capture authentic human decision-making patterns, and (2) focus on isolated tasks rather than continuous workflows, missing the pre-assistance behavioral context essential for learning proactive intervention signals. To address these gaps, we introduce ProAgentBench, a rigorous benchmark for proactive agents in working scenarios. Our contributions include: (1) a hierarchical task framework that decomposes proactive assistance into timing prediction and assist content generation; (2) a privacy-compliant dataset with 28,000+ events from 500+ hours of real user sessions, preserving bursty interaction patterns (burstiness B=0.787) absent in synthetic data; and (3) extensive experiments that evaluates LLM- and VLM-based baselines. Numerically, we showed that long-term memory and historical context significantly enhance prediction accuracy, while real-world training data substantially outperforms synthetic alternatives. We release our dataset and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProAgentBench-6BC0.</p></details> |  |

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.</p></details> |  |

To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

We present Guardian Angel, a low-cost, screenless wearable paired with a WhatsApp-based LLM agent that delivers plain-language, personalized insights. The LLM operates directly on raw, noisy sensor waveforms and is robust to the poor signal quality of low-cost hardware. On a benchmark dataset, a standard open-source algorithm produced valid outputs for only 70.29% of segments, whereas Guardian Angel achieved 100% availability (reported as coverage under field noise, distinct from accuracy), yielding a continuous and understandable physiological record. In a 96-hour study involving 20 participants (1,920 participant-hours), users demonstrated significant improvements in health data comprehension and mindfulness of vital signs. These results suggest a practical approach to enhancing health literacy and adoption in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

To avoid costly agent training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference;27 pages,15 figures</p></details> |
| **[TxRay: Agentic Postmortem of Live Blockchain Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01317v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has turned blockchains into financial infrastructure, allowing anyone to trade, lend, and build protocols without intermediaries, but this openness exposes pools of value controlled by code. Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies. We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions. To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +22.9pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

However, this paradigm shifts control from deterministic code to probabilistic inference, creating a fundamental Trust-Authorization Mismatch: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we survey more than 200 representative papers to categorize the emerging landscape of agent security. We propose the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework as a unifying formal lens. By decomposing agent execution into three distinct stages-Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant-we demonstrate that diverse threats, from prompt injection to tool poisoning, share a common root cause: the desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization boundaries. Using the B-I-P lens, we systematically map existing attacks and defenses and identify critical gaps where current mechanisms fail to bridge this mismatch. Finally, we outline a research agenda for shifting from static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Formalizing LLM-Based Agent Designs through Structural Context Modeling and Semantic Dynamics Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08276v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on large language model (LLM) agents is fragmented: discussions of conceptual frameworks and methodological principles are frequently intertwined with low-level implementation details, causing both readers and authors to lose track amid a proliferation of superficially distinct concepts. We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkillRL: Evolving Agents via Recursive Skill-Augmented Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08234v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown stunning results in complex tasks, yet they often operate in isolation, failing to learn from past experiences. Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

An Iterative Design Study in Emergency Preparedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21868v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policymakers must often act under conditions of deep uncertainty, such as emergency response, where predicting the specific impacts of a policy apriori is implausible. Large Language Model (LLM) agent simulations have been proposed as tools to support policymakers under these conditions, yet little is known about how such simulations become useful for real-world policy practice. To address this gap, we conducted a year-long, stakeholder-engaged design process with a university emergency preparedness team. Through iterative design cycles, we developed and refined an LLM agent simulation of a large-scale campus gathering, ultimately scaling to 13,000 agents that modeled crowd movement and communication under various emergency scenarios. Rather than producing predictive forecasts, these simulations supported policy practice by shaping volunteer training, evacuation procedures, and infrastructure planning. Analyzing these findings, we identify three design process implications for making LLM agent simulations that are useful for policy practice: start from verifiable scenarios to bootstrap trust, use preliminary simulations to elicit tacit domain knowledge, and treat simulation capabilities and policy implementation as co-evolving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Strategic Optimization: Rethinking Long-Horizon Decision-Making in Adversarial Poker Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08041v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language model (LLM) agents for adversarial games is often driven by episodic objectives such as win rate. In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive, Scalable, and Robust Coordination of LLM Agents: A Dynamic Ad-Hoc Networking Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08009v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent architectures built on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to realize swarm intelligence through well-crafted collaboration. However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.</p></details> |  |

As these skills proliferate in public marketplaces, it is unclear what types are available, how users adopt them, and what risks they pose. To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40,285 publicly listed skills from a major marketplace. Our results show that skill publication tends to occur in short bursts that track shifts in community attention. We also find that skill content is highly concentrated in software engineering workflows, while information retrieval and content creation account for a substantial share of adoption. Beyond content trends, we uncover a pronounced supply-demand imbalance across categories, and we show that most skills remain within typical prompt budgets despite a heavy-tailed length distribution. Finally, we observe strong ecosystem homogeneity, with widespread intent-level redundancy, and we identify non-trivial safety risks, including skills that enable state-changing or system-level actions. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative snapshot of agent skills as an emerging infrastructure layer for agents and inform future work on skill reuse, standardization, and safety-aware design.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASA: Training-Free Representation Engineering for Tool-Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04935v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting LLM agents to domain-specific tool calling remains notably brittle under evolving interfaces. Prompt and schema engineering is easy to deploy but often fragile under distribution shift and strict parsers, while continual parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves reliability at the cost of training, maintenance, and potential forgetting. We identify a critical Lazy Agent failure mode where tool necessity is nearly perfectly decodable from mid-layer activations, yet the model remains conservative in entering tool mode, revealing a representation-behavior gap. We propose Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a training-free, inference-time controller that performs a single-shot mid-layer intervention and targets tool domains via a router-conditioned mixture of steering vectors with a probe-guided signed gate to amplify true intent while suppressing spurious triggers. On MTU-Bench with Qwen2.5-1.5B, ASA improves strict tool-use F1 from 0.18 to 0.50 while reducing the false positive rate from 0.15 to 0.05, using only about 20KB of portable assets and no weight updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual-Loop Agent Framework for Automated Vulnerability Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05721v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions requires generating executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and validating them in target environments. This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose CVE2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the Tactical Loop for code-level refinement, while the Strategic Loop for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that CVE2PoC achieves 82.9% and 54.3% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3% and 20.4%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is a crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems.

| **[Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2026</p></details> |

Unlike invoking a fixed set of API tools, repository-scale model selection must handle massive, evolving candidates with incomplete metadata. Existing approaches incorporate full model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, excessive token costs, and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, the first framework to recast model selection as an iterative reasoning process rather than one-shot retrieval. By synergistically integrating Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, HuggingR$^4$ progressively decomposes user intent, retrieves candidates through multi-round deliberation, refines selections via fine-grained analysis, and validates results through reflection. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce a large-scale benchmark comprising 14,399 diverse user requests across 37 task categories. Experiments demonstrate that HuggingR$^4$ achieves 92.03% workability and 82.46% reasonability-outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines by 26.51% and 33.25%, respectively, while reducing token consumption by $6.9 \times$.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |

We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack. We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length. On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring. Our research highlights how AgentTrace can enable more reliable agent deployment, fine-grained risk analysis, and informed trust calibration, thereby addressing critical concerns that have so far limited the use of LLM agents in sensitive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Workshop LaMAS</p></details> |

We present ADCanvas, a multimodal authoring system that supports non-visual control over audio description (AD) creation. ADCanvas combines conversational interaction with keyboard-based playback control and a plain-text, screen reader-accessible editor to support end-to-end AD authoring and visual question answering (VQA). Combining screen-reader-friendly controls with a multimodal LLM agent, ADCanvas supports live VQA, script generation, and AD modification. Through a user study with 12 BLV video creators, we find that users adopt the conversational agent as an informational aide and drafting assistant, while maintaining agency through verification and editing. For example, participants saw themselves as curators who received information from the model and filtered it down for their audience. Our findings offer design implications for accessible media tools, including precise editing controls, accessibility support for creative ideation, and configurable rules for human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, published in CHI '26</p></details> |
| **[PhysicsAgentABM: Physics-Guided Generative Agent-Based Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06030v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Eurip...</summary><p>Eurips Workshop on Principles of Generative Modeling (PriGM)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: Structured Cognitive Loop with a Governance Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673v4)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). Soft Symbolic Control constitutes a dedicated governance layer within SCL, applying symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference while preserving the flexibility of neural reasoning and restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This revised version strengthens the architectural clarity and conceptual coherence of the manuscript. In particular, it formalizes Soft Symbolic Control as a dedicated Governance layer distinct from the R-CCAM loop, clarifying its structural role beyond the earlier meta-prompt add-on formulation</p></details> |
| **[LLM Active Alignment: A Nash Equilibrium Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06836v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: Structured Cognitive Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184v4)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman dual-system theory, Friston predictive processing, Minsky society of mind, and Clark extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address limitations of large language models LLMs, Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules - Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory - organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis showed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories. This suggests that theoretical convergence may arise from implementation constraints rather than deliberate synthesis. In controlled evaluations, the structured agent achieved 95.8 percent task success compared to 62.3 percent for baseline LLMs, demonstrating stronger constraint adherence and more reproducible reasoning. We characterize this convergence through a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this abstraction generalizes principles first realized in Agentic Flow as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents.Rather than asserting theoretical unification, this position paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical demands. Agentic Flow thus functions as an implementation instance of the Structured Cognitive Loop, illustrating how a unified cognitive form can emerge not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This revised version improves conceptual consistency between Agentic Flow and the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL; arXiv:2510.05107)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment. To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</p></details> | 81 pages |

However, feature-driven development, a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world end-to-end feature-driven software development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. We evaluated SWE-Dev across 17 base LLMs, 10 reasoning-focused LLMs, 10 multi-agent systems, and 8 tool-augmented LLM agents. Results show substantial headroom: the best single-turn model reaches only 22.51\% Pass@1 on the hard split, while OpenHands agents improve to 56.44\% but still leave many tasks unsolved.

While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment. The relevance assessment framework is available at https: //github.com/DISL-Lab/DREAM-ICLR-26; and the BRIDGE dataset is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/BRIDGE-Benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[TrajAD: Trajectory Anomaly Detection for Trustworthy LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06443v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of runtime trajectory anomaly detection, a critical capability for enabling trustworthy LLM agents. Current safety measures predominantly focus on static input/output filtering. However, we argue that ensuring LLM agents reliability requires auditing the intermediate execution process. In this work, we formulate the task of Trajectory Anomaly Detection. The goal is not merely detection, but precise error localization. This capability is essential for enabling efficient rollback-and-retry. To achieve this, we construct TrajBench, a dataset synthesized via a perturb-and-complete strategy to cover diverse procedural anomalies. Using this benchmark, we investigate the capability of models in process supervision. We observe that general-purpose LLMs, even with zero-shot prompting, struggle to identify and localize these anomalies. This reveals that generalized capabilities do not automatically translate to process reliability. To address this, we propose TrajAD, a specialized verifier trained with fine-grained process supervision. Our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating that specialized supervision is essential for building trustworthy agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Adversary Tactics and Techniques in Malware Binaries with an LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06325v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in malware binaries is essential for security analysis and threat intelligence, yet remains challenging in practice. Real-world malware binaries are typically stripped of symbols, contain large numbers of functions, and distribute malicious behavior across multiple code regions, making TTP attribution difficult. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer strong code understanding capabilities, but applying them directly to this task faces challenges in identifying analysis entry points, reasoning under partial observability, and misalignment with TTP-specific decision logic. We present TTPDetect, the first LLM agent for recognizing TTPs in stripped malware binaries. TTPDetect combines dense retrieval with LLM-based neural retrieval to narrow the space of analysis entry points. TTPDetect further employs a function-level analyzing agent consisting of a Context Explorer that performs on-demand, incremental context retrieval and a TTP-Specific Reasoning Guideline that achieves inference-time alignment. We build a new dataset that labels decompiled functions with TTPs across diverse malware families and platforms. TTPDetect achieves 93.25% precision and 93.81% recall on function-level TTP recognition, outperforming baselines by 10.38% and 18.78%, respectively. When evaluated on real world malware samples, TTPDetect recognizes TTPs with a precision of 87.37%. For malware with expert-written reports, TTPDetect recovers 85.7% of the documented TTPs and further discovers, on average, 10.5 previously unreported TTPs per malware.</p></details> |  |
| **[RuleSmith: Multi-Agent LLMs for Automated Game Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06232v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ViktorAxelsen/BudgetMem</p></details> |

Our vision is that LLM agents should resemble remote human collaborators, which allows HCI researchers to ground the future exploration in decades of research on trust, awareness, and common ground in remote human collaboration, while also revealing the unique opportunities and challenges that emerge when one or more partners are AI agents. This workshop establishes a foundational research agenda for the new era by posing the question: How can the rich understanding of remote human collaboration inspire and inform the design and study of human-agent collaboration? We will bring together an interdisciplinary group from HCI, CSCW, and AI to explore this critical transition. The 180-minute workshop will be highly interactive, featuring a keynote speaker, a series of invited lightning talks, and an exploratory group design session where participants will storyboard novel paradigms of human-agent partnership. Our goal is to enlighten the research community by cultivating a shared vocabulary and producing a research agenda that charts the future of collaborative agents.</p></details> |  |

Recent work simulates opinion dynamics with role-playing LLM agents (RPLAs), but multi-agent simulations often display unnatural group behavior (e.g., premature convergence) and lack empirical benchmarks for assessing alignment with real human group interactions. We introduce DEBATE, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of opinion dynamics in multi-agent RPLA simulations. DEBATE contains 36,383 messages from 2,832 U.S.-based participants across 708 groups and 107 topics, with both public messages and private Likert-scale beliefs, enabling evaluation at the utterance and group levels (and supporting future individual-level analyses). We instantiate "digital twin" RPLAs with seven LLMs and evaluate across two settings: next-message prediction and full conversation rollout, using stance-alignment and opinion-convergence metrics. In zero-shot settings, RPLA groups exhibit strong opinion convergence relative to human groups. Post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves stance alignment and brings group-level convergence closer to human behavior, though discrepancies in opinion change and belief updating remain. DEBATE enables rigorous benchmarking of simulated opinion dynamics and supports future research on aligning multi-agent RPLAs with realistic human interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgenticTagger: Structured Item Representation for Recommendation with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05945v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.</p></details> |  |

Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables. Our findings challenge common assumptions. First, architecture choice is model-dependent: file-based context retrieval improves accuracy for frontier-tier models (Claude, GPT, Gemini; +2.7%, p=0.029) but shows mixed results for open source models (aggregate -7.7%, p<0.001), with deficits varying substantially by model. Second, format does not significantly affect aggregate accuracy (chi-squared=2.45, p=0.484), though individual models, particularly open source, exhibit format-specific sensitivities. Third, model capability is the dominant factor, with a 21 percentage point accuracy gap between frontier and open source tiers that dwarfs any format or architecture effect. Fourth, file-native agents scale to 10,000 tables through domain-partitioned schemas while maintaining high navigation accuracy. Fifth, file size does not predict runtime efficiency: compact formats can consume significantly more tokens at scale due to format-unfamiliar search patterns. These findings provide practitioners with evidence-based guidance for deploying LLM agents on structured systems, demonstrating that architectural decisions should be tailored to model capability rather than assuming universal best practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables, 26 references</p></details> |

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. Specifically, we propose a reflective LLM coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our agent substantially improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R$^{2}$ and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving places of interest (POIs)' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with Web technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

| **[ProAct: Agentic Lookahead in Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05327v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/GreatX3/ProAct</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: The Real Barrier to LLM Agent Usability is Agentic ROI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17767v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. While LLM agents are technically capable of performing a broad range of tasks, not all of these capabilities translate into meaningful usability. This position paper argues that the central question for LLM agent usability is no longer whether a task can be automated, but whether it delivers sufficient Agentic Return on Investment (Agentic ROI). Agentic ROI reframes evaluation from raw performance to a holistic, utility-driven perspective, guiding when, where, and for whom LLM agents should be deployed. Despite widespread application in high-ROI tasks like coding and scientific research, we identify a critical usability gap in mass-market, everyday applications. To address this, we propose a zigzag developmental trajectory: first scaling up to improve information gain and time savings, then scaling down to reduce cost. We present a strategic roadmap across these phases to make LLM agents truly usable, accessible, and scalable in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22129v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Reasoning: Training-Free Interactive Thinking LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10931v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embodied assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of positional embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential generation to simultaneously think, listen, and write outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning: it allows models to generate accurate thinking-augmented answers while reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to ${\le}$ 5s and the overall real-time delays by up to $12{\times}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

We introduce T2L, an executable framework for project-level, line-level vulnerability localization that progressively narrows scope from repository modules to exact vulnerable lines via AST-based chunking and evidence-guided refinement. We provide a baseline agent with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses runtime evidence such as crash points and stack traces to translate failure symptoms into actionable diagnoses. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce T2L-ARVO, an expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families in real-world projects. On T2L-ARVO, our baseline achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization rate. Together, T2L framework advance LLM-based vulnerability detection toward deployable, precision diagnostics in open-source software workflows.</p></details> |  |

Existing molecular generation methods can aid the design of OSC molecules, but they are mostly confined to optimizing known backbones and lack effective use of domain-specific chemical knowledge, often leading to unrealistic candidates. In this paper, we introduce OSCAgent, a multi-agent framework for OSC molecular discovery that unifies retrieval-augmented design, molecular generation, and systematic evaluation into a continuously improving pipeline, without requiring additional human intervention. OSCAgent comprises three collaborative agents. The Planner retrieves knowledge from literature-curated molecules and prior candidates to guide design directions. The Generator proposes new OSC acceptors aligned with these plans. The Experimenter performs comprehensive evaluation of candidate molecules and provides feedback for refinement. Experiments show that OSCAgent produces chemically valid, synthetically accessible OSC molecules and achieves superior predicted performance compared to both traditional and large language model (LLM)-only baselines. Representative results demonstrate that some candidates achieve predicted efficiencies approaching 18\%. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we present a systematic review of recent advances in applying LLM agents to address key challenges in educational settings, such as feedback comment generation, curriculum design, etc. We analyze the technologies enabling these agents, including representative datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks. Additionally, we highlight key challenges in deploying LLM agents in educational settings, including ethical issues, hallucination and overreliance, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. Beyond the core technical focus, we include in Appendix A a comprehensive overview of domain-specific educational agents, covering areas such as science learning, language learning, and professional development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Existing works equip large language models with a memory buffer that is dynamically updated via a linear document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from pruning of latent evidence, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, which integrates the mechanism of memory retrieval into the memory update process, enabling the agent to selectively callback historical memories for non-linear reasoning. To further strengthen training, we propose a multi-level reward design, which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support complex multi-hop reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMemR1 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-context question answering while incurring negligible computational overhead, validating its ability to trade marginal cost for robust long-context reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Pruner: Self-Adaptive Context Pruning for Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16746v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified while even improving success rates, and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/Ayanami1314/swe-pruner</p></details> |
| **[Defending Against Prompt Injection with DataFilter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19207v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate tasks and interact with untrusted external data, prompt injection emerges as a significant security threat. By injecting malicious instructions into the data that LLMs access, an attacker can arbitrarily override the original user task and redirect the agent toward unintended, potentially harmful actions. Existing defenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur substantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system redesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time model-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before it reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning on simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data to selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information. Across multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt injection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs' utility. DataFilter delivers strong security, high utility, and plug-and-play deployment, making it a strong practical defense to secure black-box commercial LLMs against prompt injection. Our DataFilter model is released at https://huggingface.co/JoyYizhu/DataFilter for immediate use, with the code to reproduce our results at https://github.com/yizhu-joy/DataFilter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Omit: Training Efficient LLM Agents for Adaptive Thought and Observation Omission via Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04284v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Agent-Omit.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[From Helpfulness to Toxic Proactivity: Diagnosing Behavioral Misalignment in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04197v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding appendices), 6 figures.

We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Epistemic Control for Query-Efficient Verified Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03974v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentArk: Distilling Multi-Agent Intelligence into a Single LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03955v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

| **[An Empirical Study of Collective Behaviors and Social Dynamics in Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03775v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cortex: Achieving Low-Latency, Cost-Efficient Remote Data Access For LLM via Semantic-Aware Knowledge Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17360v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce Cortex, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Seri). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Seri then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Cortex builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Cortex co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Cortex delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Cortex achieves up to a 3.6x increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Cortex also improves throughput for coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ontology-to-tools compilation for executable semantic constraint enforcement in LLM agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03439v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verified Critical Step Optimization for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03412v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[TIDE: Trajectory-based Diagnostic Evaluation of Test-Time Improvement in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02196v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.</p></details> | 29pages, 10 figures |

Yet existing SZZ-based approaches are limited by their reliance on git blame, which restricts the search space to commits that directly modified the fixed lines. Our preliminary study on 2,102 validated bug-fixing commits reveals that this limitation is significant: over 40% of cases cannot be solved by blame alone, as 28% of BICs require traversing commit history beyond blame results and 14% are blameless. We present AgenticSZZ, the first approach to apply Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to software evolution analysis. AgenticSZZ reframes BIC identification from a ranking problem over blame commits into a graph search problem, where temporal ordering is fundamental to causal reasoning about bug introduction. The approach operates in two phases: (1) constructing a TKG that encodes commits with temporal and structural relationships, expanding the search space by traversing file history backward from two reference points (blame commits and the BFC); and (2) leveraging an LLM agent to navigate the graph using specialized tools for candidate exploration and causal analysis. Evaluation on three datasets shows that AgenticSZZ achieves F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art by up to 27%. Our ablation study confirms that both components are essential, reflecting a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off: the TKG expands the search space while the agent provides intelligent selection. By transforming BIC identification into a graph search problem, we open a new research direction for temporal and causal reasoning in software evolution analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language Actor-Critic: Scalable Off-Policy Learning in Language Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04601v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Task Solving to Robust Real-World Adaptation in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02760v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly deployed as specialized agents that plan, call tools, and take actions over extended horizons. Yet many existing evaluations assume a "clean interface" where dynamics are specified and stable, tools and sensors are reliable, and success is captured by a single explicit objective-often overestimating real-world readiness. In practice, agents face underspecified rules, unreliable signals, shifting environments, and implicit, multi-stakeholder goals. The challenge is therefore not just solving tasks, but adapting while solving: deciding what to trust, what is wanted, when to verify, and when to fall back or escalate. We stress-test deployment-relevant robustness under four operational circumstances: partial observability, dynamic environments, noisy signals, and dynamic agent state. We benchmark agentic LLMs in a grid-based game with a simple goal but long-horizon execution. Episodes violate clean-interface assumptions yet remain solvable, forcing agents to infer rules, pay for information, adapt to environmental and internal shifts, and act cautiously under noise. Across five state-of-the-art LLM agents, we find large gaps between nominal task-solving and deployment-like robustness. Performance generally degrades as grid size and horizon increase, but rankings are unstable: weaker models can beat stronger ones when strategy matches the uncertainty regime. Despite no explicit instruction, agents trade off completion, efficiency, and penalty avoidance, suggesting partial objective inference. Ablations and feature analyses reveal model-specific sensitivities and failure drivers, motivating work on verification, safe action selection, and objective inference under partial observability, noise, and non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |

We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation.

These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ViktorAxelsen/MemSkill</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks typically assume well-specified instructions or restrict evaluation to text-only, single-turn clarification, and thus do not measure multi-turn disambiguation under grounded execution risk. We introduce \textbf{Drift-Bench}, the first diagnostic benchmark that evaluates agentic pragmatics under input faults through multi-turn clarification across state-oriented and service-oriented execution environments. Grounded in classical theories of communication, \textbf{Drift-Bench} provides a unified taxonomy of cooperative breakdowns and employs a persona-driven user simulator with the \textbf{Rise} evaluation protocol. Experiments show substantial performance drops under these faults, with clarification effectiveness varying across user personas and fault types. \MethodName bridges clarification research and agent safety evaluation, enabling systematic diagnosis of failures that can lead to unsafe executions.</p></details> | 65 pages, 40 figures |

Recent \emph{self-evolving} systems update memory based on interaction outcomes, but most existing evolution pipelines are developed for static train/test splits and only approximate online learning by folding static benchmarks, making them brittle under true distribution shift and continuous feedback. We introduce \textsc{Live-Evo}, an online self-evolving memory system that learns from a stream of incoming data over time. \textsc{Live-Evo} decouples \emph{what happened} from \emph{how to use it} via an Experience Bank and a Meta-Guideline Bank, compiling task-adaptive guidelines from retrieved experiences for each task. To manage memory online, \textsc{Live-Evo} maintains experience weights and updates them from feedback: experiences that consistently help are reinforced and retrieved more often, while misleading or stale experiences are down-weighted and gradually forgotten, analogous to reinforcement and decay in human memory. On the live \textit{Prophet Arena} benchmark over a 10-week horizon, \textsc{Live-Evo} improves Brier score by 20.8\% and increases market returns by 12.9\%, while also transferring to deep-research benchmarks with consistent gains over strong baselines.

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Consolidation for Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01966v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities, they typically operate as static systems, lacking the ability to evolve through lifelong interaction. Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework that probes fine-grained clinical understanding through controlled counterfactuals. Using intensive care unit (ICU) discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, we construct both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) variants with single-variable perturbations in demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate eight LLMs, spanning general-purpose and medical variants, under zero-shot setting. Model behavior is analyzed through (1) input-level sensitivity, capturing how counterfactuals alter perplexity, and (2) downstream reasoning, measuring their effect on predicted ICU length-of-stay and mortality. Overall, our results show that standard task metrics obscure clinically relevant differences in model behavior, with models differing substantially in how consistently and proportionally they adjust predictions to counterfactual perturbations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items ("must-ask" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnatomiX, an Anatomy-Aware Grounded Multimodal Large Language Model for Chest X-Ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03191v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

| **[Measuring Stability Beyond Accuracy in Small Open-Source Medical Large Language Models for Pediatric Endocrinology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11567v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small open-source medical large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for low-resource deployment and broader accessibility. However, their evaluation is often limited to accuracy on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks, and lacks evaluation of consistency, robustness, or reasoning behavior. We use MCQ coupled to human evaluation and clinical review to assess six small open-source medical LLMs (HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen 2024), Diabetica-7B, Diabetica-o1 (Wei 2024), Meditron3-8B (Sallinen2025), MedFound-7B (Liu 2025), and ClinicaGPT-base-zh (Wang 2023)) in pediatric endocrinology. In deterministic settings, we examine the effect of prompt variation on models' output and self-assessment bias. In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, accepted at 47 workshop Reproducible Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026, Singapore, January 27, 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Behavioral Distillation Breaks Safety Alignment in Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09403v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored. We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments. Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Framework for Evaluating Medical AI Security: Reproducible Assessment of Jailbreaking and Privacy Vulnerabilities Across Clinical Specialties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08185v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for clinical decision support across diverse specialties, yet systematic evaluation of their robustness to adversarial misuse and privacy leakage remains inaccessible to most researchers. Existing security benchmarks require GPU clusters, commercial API access, or protected health data -- barriers that limit community participation in this critical research area. We propose a practical, fully reproducible framework for evaluating medical AI security under realistic resource constraints. Our framework design covers multiple medical specialties stratified by clinical risk -- from high-risk domains such as emergency medicine and psychiatry to general practice -- addressing jailbreaking attacks (role-playing, authority impersonation, multi-turn manipulation) and privacy extraction attacks. All evaluation utilizes synthetic patient records requiring no IRB approval. The framework is designed to run entirely on consumer CPU hardware using freely available models, eliminating cost barriers. We present the framework specification including threat models, data generation methodology, evaluation protocols, and scoring rubrics. This proposal establishes a foundation for comparative security assessment of medical-specialist models and defense mechanisms, advancing the broader goal of ensuring safe and trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, framework proposal</p></details> |

We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alignment Paradox of Medical Large Language Models in Infertility Care: Decoupling Algorithmic Improvement from Clinical Decision-making Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18084v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.</p></details> | 22 pages 5 figures |

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

It enables multi-turn conversation in Arabic and English and supports diverse medical imaging modalities, including radiology, CT, and histology. To train BiMediX2, we curate BiMed-V, an extensive Arabic-English bilingual healthcare dataset consisting of 1.6M samples of diverse medical interactions. This dataset supports a range of medical Large Language Model (LLM) and Large Multimodal Model (LMM) tasks, including multi-turn medical conversations, report generation, and visual question answering (VQA).

This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.</p></details> |  |
| **[CURE: Confidence-driven Unified Reasoning Ensemble Framework for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14353v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 12 pages,3 figures |
| **[ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

| **[EH-Benchmark Ophthalmic Hallucination Benchmark and Agent-Driven Top-Down Traceable Reasoning Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22929v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 5 tables. submit/6621751</p></details> |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[MedEthicsQA: A Comprehensive Question Answering Benchmark for Medical Ethics Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22808v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment.

Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17163v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios.

| **[Medical large language models are easily distracted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01201v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform medicine, but real-world clinical scenarios contain extraneous information that can hinder performance. The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |
| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks.

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use. These findings reveal both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios and offer critical insights for medical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ENMLP-2024</p></details> |
| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers. To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Towards Training A Chinese Large Language Model for Anesthesiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02742v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity recently due to their significant practical utility. However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce MedBench, a comprehensive benchmark for the Chinese medical domain, comprising 40,041 questions sourced from authentic examination exercises and medical reports of diverse branches of medicine. In particular, this benchmark is composed of four key components: the Chinese Medical Licensing Examination, the Resident Standardization Training Examination, the Doctor In-Charge Qualification Examination, and real-world clinic cases encompassing examinations, diagnoses, and treatments. MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge. These findings elucidate both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs within the context of MedBench, with the ultimate goal of aiding the medical research community.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI-24 |

Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.</p></details> |  |

We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks. By isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary, AlignTune enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Libra...</summary><p>Library opensource and available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/aligntune</p></details> |
| **[Weight Decay Improves Language Model Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11137v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proficient Graph Neural Network Design by Accumulating Knowledge on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06717v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experience into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well-suited for meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search cost compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2026.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model.</p></details> | 41 pages |
| **[PALM: Path-aware LLM-based Test Generation with Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code, including library functions, in terms of symbolic constraints and by the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulas, by instead constructing program variants that the LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM provides an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> | 11 pages, v2 |
| **[Can Large Language Models Make Everyone Happy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11091v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DataChef: Cooking Up Optimal Data Recipes for LLM Adaptation via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11089v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the curation of large-scale, high-quality training data is a primary driver of model performance. A key lever is the \emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B. This work sheds new light on automating LLM training and developing self-evolving AI systems.</p></details> |  |

While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution, their performance limits can lead to a critical compromise: using a precomputed, static secret basis to accelerate cryptographic operations. We demonstrate that this mainstream design pattern introduces a classic cryptographic flaw, the reuse of secret keying material, into the system's protocol. We prove its vulnerability with two distinct attacks: First, our attack on a model confidentiality system achieves a full confidentiality break by recovering its secret permutations and model weights. Second, our integrity attack completely bypasses the integrity checks of systems like Soter and TSQP. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks against state-of-the-art LLMs, recovering a layer's secrets from a LLaMA-3 8B model in about 6 minutes and showing the attack scales to compromise 405B-parameter LLMs across a variety of configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Attention Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24544v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge, cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative decoding.</p></details> |  |

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de.</p></details> |  |

Experiments with polymers have a long trial-and-error process, leading to use of extensive resources. For these processes, machine learning has accelerated scientific discovery at the property prediction and latent space search fronts. However, laboratory researchers cannot readily access codes and these models to extract individual structures and properties due to infrastructure limitations. We present a closed-loop polymer structure-property predictor integrated in a terminal for early-stage polymer discovery. The framework is powered by LLM reasoning to provide users with property prediction, property-guided polymer structure generation, and structure modification capabilities. The SMILES sequences are guided by the synthetic accessibility score and the synthetic complexity score (SC Score) to ensure that polymer generation is as close as possible to synthetically accessible monomer-level structures. This framework addresses the challenge of generating novel polymer structures for laboratory researchers, thereby providing computational insights into polymer research.</p></details> |  |

This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

We leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global, session-level feedback. Our first \emph{text-only} variant prompts the LLM to perform reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second \emph{multimodal} variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This industry paper demonstrates how emerging Kubernetes-native projects can be combined to deliver the benefits of container orchestration, such as scalability and resource efficiency, to complex AI workflows. We implement and evaluate an illustrative, multi-stage use case consisting of automatic speech recognition and summarization. First, we address batch inference by using Kueue to manage jobs that transcribe audio files with Whisper models and Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) to increase parallel job execution. Second, we address a discrete online inference scenario by feeding the transcripts to a Large Language Model for summarization hosted using llm-d, a novel solution utilizing the recent developments around the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) for optimized routing of inference requests. Our findings illustrate that these complementary components (Kueue, DAS, and GAIE) form a cohesive, high-performance platform, proving Kubernetes' capability to serve as a unified foundation for demanding GenAI workloads: Kueue reduced total makespan by up to 15%; DAS shortened mean job completion time by 36\%; and GAIE working in conjunction with llm-d improved tail Time to First Token latency by up to 90% even under high loads.</p></details> | <details><summary>A acc...</summary><p>A accepted at the 17th International Conference on Performance Engineering</p></details> |

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

| **[Information Abstraction for Data Transmission Networks based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11022v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological systems, particularly the human brain, achieve remarkable energy efficiency by abstracting information across multiple hierarchical levels. In contrast, modern artificial intelligence and communication systems often consume significant energy overheads in transmitting low-level data, with limited emphasis on abstraction. Despite its implicit importance, a formal and computational theory of information abstraction remains absent. In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Our results suggest that DIA offers a principled tool for rebalancing energy and information in intelligent systems and opens new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13553v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The RB Controller showed a stronger impact than the NL Controller, which uses a small (7B/8B) LLM to simulate human-like interventions. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgery: Mitigating Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Attention Sink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05228v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

| **[Fine-Tuning GPT-5 for GPU Kernel Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11000v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Human-Centric Framework for Data Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10995v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, creators have little agency over how their data is used, and LLM users may find themselves unknowingly plagiarizing existing sources. Attribution of LLM-generated text to LLM input data could help with these challenges, but so far we have more questions than answers: what elements of LLM outputs require attribution, what goals should it serve, how should it be implemented? We contribute a human-centric data attribution framework, which situates the attribution problem within the broader data economy. Specific use cases for attribution, such as creative writing assistance or fact-checking, can be specified via a set of parameters (including stakeholder objectives and implementation criteria). These criteria are up for negotiation by the relevant stakeholder groups: creators, LLM users, and their intermediaries (publishers, platforms, AI companies). The outcome of domain-specific negotiations can be implemented and tested for whether the stakeholder goals are achieved. The proposed approach provides a bridge between methodological NLP work on data attribution, governance work on policy interventions, and economic analysis of creator incentives for a sustainable equilibrium in the data economy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeatureBench: Benchmarking Agentic Coding for Complex Feature Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10975v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are reworking the methodlogy and labels, creating more diversity and a better dataset</p></details> |

Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.</p></details> |  |

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10964v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory. Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases. Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers. We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has primarily focused on training-time optimization, our work highlights inference-time reward model (RM)-based reasoning as a critical yet overlooked avenue. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of RM behavior across downstream reasoning tasks, revealing three key limitations: (1) RM can impair performance on simple questions, (2) its discriminative ability declines with increased sampling, and (3) high search diversity undermines RM performance. To address these issues, we propose CRISP (Clustered Reward Integration with Stepwise Prefixing), a novel inference-time algorithm that clusters generated reasoning paths by final answers, aggregates reward signals at the cluster level, and adaptively updates prefix prompts to guide generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CRISP significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance, achieving up to 5% accuracy improvement over other RM-based inference methods and an average of 10% gain over advanced reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 30 figures, Accpeted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, existing approaches often rely on pretrained encoders, semantic distillation, or heterogeneous CNN-based architectures. These designs introduce fixed inductive biases that limit reconstruction fidelity and hinder effective scaling. In this paper, we argue that discrete audio tokenization should be learned fully end-to-end using a homogeneous and scalable architecture. To this end, we first propose CAT (Causal Audio Tokenizer with Transformer), a purely Transformer-based architecture that jointly optimizes the encoder, quantizer, and decoder from scratch for high-fidelity reconstruction. Building on the CAT architecture, we develop MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer, a large-scale audio tokenizer featuring 1.6 billion parameters, pre-trained on 3 million hours of diverse, general audio data. We show that this simple, fully end-to-end approach built from homogeneous, causal Transformer blocks scales gracefully and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse audio domains. Across speech, sound, and music, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer consistently outperforms prior codecs over a wide range of bitrates, while exhibiting predictable improvements with increased scale. Notably, leveraging the discrete tokens from our model, we develop the first purely autoregressive TTS model that surpasses prior non-autoregressive and cascaded systems. Furthermore, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer enables competitive ASR performance without auxiliary encoders. Our findings position the CAT architecture as a unified, scalable interface for the next generation of native audio foundation models.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.</p></details> |  |

Current implementations predominantly rely on a "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data. To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm.</p></details> | 35 pages, 15 figures |

In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</p></details> |  |

These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their extremely limited number, pruning them results in a substantial decline in model performance (e.g., prune just three out of 6,144 causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to generate repetitive and uninformative outputs).We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs: (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs is model-specific, data-agnostic, and remains unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further investigate why compressing SEs exerts such a pronounced impact. We show that, in MoE LLMs, SEs serve as the primary source of the systematic outlier mechanism in Transformers, and that compressing them profoundly disrupts this process, ultimately causing the collapse of attention sinks. These findings advance the understanding of the internal dynamics of MoE LLMs, filling an important gap in the current knowledge.

This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI.

| **[AgentCrypt: Advancing Privacy and (Secure) Computation in AI Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08104v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents increasingly operate in complex environments, ensuring reliable, context-aware privacy is critical for regulatory compliance. Traditional access controls are insufficient because privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may inadvertently compromise privacy during reasoning by messaging humans, leaking context to peers, or executing unsafe tool calls. Existing approaches typically treat privacy as a binary constraint, overlooking nuanced, computation-dependent requirements. Furthermore, Large Language Model (LLM) agents are inherently probabilistic, lacking formal guarantees for security-critical operations. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a three-tiered framework for secure agent communication that adds a deterministic protection layer atop any AI platform. AgentCrypt spans the full spectrum of privacy needs: from unrestricted data exchange (Level 1), to context-aware masking (Level 2), up to fully encrypted computation using Homomorphic Encryption (Level 3). Unlike prompt-based defenses, our approach guarantees that tagged data privacy is strictly preserved even when the underlying model errs. Security is decoupled from the agent's probabilistic reasoning, ensuring sensitive data remains protected throughout the computational lifecycle. AgentCrypt enables collaborative computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers like data silos. We implemented and validated it using LangGraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across architectures. Finally, we introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks to enable systematic evaluation and foster the development of trustworthy, regulatable machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Diagnosing Structural Failures in LLM-Based Evidence Extraction for Meta-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10881v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis. The code and data are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/zhiyintan/LLM-Meta-Analysis).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 22nd Conference on Information and Research Science Connecting to Digital and Library Science (IRCDL 2026)</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.</p></details> |  |

We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Induced Bias Toward LLM-Generated Content in Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10833v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called "source bias", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026</p></details> |
| **[RePO: Bridging On-Policy Learning and Off-Policy Knowledge through Rephrasing Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10819v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[HarmMetric Eval: Benchmarking Metrics and Judges for LLM Harmfulness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24384v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential for large language models (LLMs) to generate harmful content poses a significant safety risk in their deployment. To address and assess this risk, the community has developed numerous harmfulness evaluation metrics and judges. However, the lack of a systematic benchmark for evaluating these metrics and judges undermines the credibility and consistency of LLM safety assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. In HarmMetric Eval, we build a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with highly diverse harmful model responses and non-harmful counterparts across multiple categories. We also propose a flexible scoring mechanism that rewards the metrics for correctly ranking harmful responses above non-harmful ones, which is applicable to almost all existing metrics and judges with varying output formats and scoring scales. Using HarmMetric Eval, we uncover a surprising finding by extensive experiments: Conventional reference-based metrics such as ROUGE and METEOR can outperform existing LLM-based judges in fine-grained harmfulness evaluation, challenging prevailing assumptions about LLMs'superiority in this domain. To reveal the reasons behind this finding, we provide a fine-grained analysis to explain the limitations of LLM-based judges on rating irrelevant or useless responses. Furthermore, we build a new harmfulness judge by incorporating the fine-grained criteria into its prompt template and leverage reference-based metrics to fine-tune its base LLM. The resulting judge demonstrates superior performance than all existing metrics and judges in evaluating harmful responses.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-based Method for Expressing Knowledge Boundary of Black-Box LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10801v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.</p></details> |  |

However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

A Knowledge-Driven Framework for Bias-Aware Literature Originality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06054v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing research novelty is a core yet highly subjective aspect of peer review, typically based on implicit judgment and incomplete comparison to prior work. We introduce a literature-aware novelty assessment framework that explicitly learns how humans judge novelty from peer-review reports and grounds these judgments in structured comparison to existing research. Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kelix Technique Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09843v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10748v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store structured factual knowledge by linking entities through relationships, crucial for many applications. These applications depend on the KG's factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on a large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing a multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes a RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. Additionally, we offer an interactive exploration platform for analyzing verification decisions. The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches -- at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of a one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for a benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progress on this difficult yet crucial task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper by the 29th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT'26)</p></details> |
| **[ACT: Agentic Classification Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26433v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Beyond Gemini-3-Pro: Revisiting LLM Routing and Aggregation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01330v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, with Gemini-3-Pro setting a new performance milestone. In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment for Domain-Adaptive VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10740v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOute: Cost-Efficient LLM Serving with Heterogeneous LLMs and GPUs via Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10729v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) deployments has made cost-efficient serving systems essential. Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving.</p></details> | MLSys 2026 |

However, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present 'Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on 22 SE textual artifacts NLU tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort required to implement a development task. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) tasks, with data drawn from diverse sources such as issue tracking systems and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, both generalist and domain-adapted; and prompt two proprietary alternatives using zero-shot a 3-shot prompting strategies. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that fine-tuned models across various sizes and architectures perform best, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance. Furthermore, domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training does not yield significant improvements and might even be counterproductive for developer communication tasks.</p></details> |  |

We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with people in the UK who live with mental health conditions and have used LLMs for mental health support. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we found that participants engaged with LLMs in conditional and situational ways: for immediacy, the desire for non-judgement, self-paced disclosure, cognitive reframing, and relational engagement. Simultaneously, participants articulated clear boundaries informed by prior therapeutic experience: LLMs were effective for mild-to-moderate distress but inadequate for crises, trauma, and complex social-emotional situations. We contribute empirical insights into the lived use of LLMs for mental health, highlight boundary-setting as central to their safe role, and propose design and governance directions for embedding them responsibly within care ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CHI 2026 in Barcelona (ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems)</p></details> |
| **[VESPO: Variational Sequence-Level Soft Policy Optimization for Stable Off-Policy LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10693v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

| **[Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations. To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into multiple MLLM families. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

While much research has focused on potential privacy risks, less attention has been paid to the data control mechanisms these platforms provide. This study examines six conversational LLM platforms, analyzing how they define and implement features for users to access, edit, delete, and share data. Our analysis reveals an emerging paradigm of data control in conversational LLM platforms, where user data is generated and derived through interaction itself, natural language enables flexible yet often ambiguous control, and multi-user interactions with shared data raise questions of co-ownership and governance. Based on these findings, we offer practical insights for platform developers, policymakers, and researchers to design more effective and usable privacy controls in LLM-powered conversational interactions.</p></details> |  |

Our method builds digital ``marks'' using invisible Unicode characters organized into (``cue'', ``reply'') pairs. During an audit, prompts containing only ``cue'' fragments are issued to trigger regurgitation of the corresponding ``reply'', indicating document usage. To control false positives, we compare against held-out counterfactual marks and apply a ranking test, yielding a verifiable bound on the false positive rate. The approach is minimally invasive, scalable across many sources, robust to standard processing pipelines, and achieves high detection power even when marked data is a small fraction of the fine-tuning corpus.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16858v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaymoQA: A Multi-View Visual Question Answering Dataset for Safety-Critical Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20022v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.12145</p></details> |

In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.</p></details> |  |

In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is avaliable at \url{https://github.com/lern-to-write/STC}</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Attention Masking for User Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10622v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only large language models are increasingly used as behavioral encoders for user representation learning, yet the impact of attention masking on the quality of user embeddings remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment. Our work provides a foundation for systematic LLM-based ISD research.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Improving Medical Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Perception and Reasoning Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10619v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process. Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.</p></details> | CPAL 2026 |

However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICLR 2026 Project page at: https://xenozlh.github.io/Shuffle-R1/</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |
| **[ProAPO: Progressively Automatic Prompt Optimization for Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19844v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in image classification by training with large-scale paired image-text data. Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Online Causal Kalman Filtering for Stable and Effective Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10609v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Dimensional Collapse in Transformer Attention Outputs: A Challenge for Sparse Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16929v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer architectures, and their attention mechanisms in particular, form the foundation of modern large language models. While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are in fact confined to a surprisingly low-dimensional subspace, with an effective dimensionality of only about $60\%$ of the full space. In contrast, MLP outputs and residual streams remain much closer to full-rank, exhibiting effective ranks around $90\%$. This striking dimensional discrepancy is consistently observed across diverse model families and datasets, and is strongly shaped by the attention output projection matrix. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a key factor of the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language models.</p></details> | 27 pages, 16 figures |
| **[S-GRec: Personalized Semantic-Aware Generative Recommendation with Asymmetric Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10606v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation models sequence generation to produce items end-to-end, but training from behavioral logs often provides weak supervision on underlying user intent. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

Mathematical problem-solving is central to students' success in mathematics education, yet many learners struggle to plan, justify, and verify their solutions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise as intelligent tutors, they often lack structured pedagogical alignment grounded in established learning theories. To address this gap, we operationalize Polya's problem-solving framework within an instruction-tuned LLM to promote metacognitive engagement and examine the effects of pedagogy-aligned fine-tuning compared to domain-only and general-purpose instruction tuning. Built on the Llama-3.1-8B architecture, Llama-Polya was fine-tuned on synthetic math problem-solving data derived from GSM8K, structured according to Polya's four stages. We developed and evaluated multiple variants-general-purpose instruct, math-domain metamath, pedagogy-aligned polya-v2, and sequential metamath+polya-v2-using both quantitative accuracy metrics and qualitative pedagogical assessments. Results indicate that models tuned with Polya's framework and domain-specific data produced more balanced reasoning-stage distributions and fewer premature answers. Expert evaluators also observed improved pedagogical coherence and metacognitive prompting, although limitations in personalization and mathematical rigor remained. These findings suggest that pedagogy-grounded instruction tuning can enhance educational alignment and reasoning transparency in LLM-based tutoring systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-AGI: Benchmarking Specification-Driven Software Construction with MoonBit in the Era of Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09447v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive coding capabilities, their ability to autonomously build production-scale software from explicit specifications remains an open question. We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Implicit Probabilistic Reasoning Does Not Reflect Explicit Answers in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14986v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The handling of probabilities in the form of uncertainty or partial information is an essential task for LLMs in many settings and applications. A common approach to evaluate an LLM's probabilistic reasoning capabilities is to assess its ability to answer questions pertaining to probability through the use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, this paradigm, which we refer to as explicit probabilistic reasoning, has been shown in the literature to yield significant limitations (e.g., sensitivity to answer ordering). In this work, we introduce an alternative approach, named implicit probabilistic reasoning, which evaluates the models' ability to integrate probabilistic reasoning into their text generation process. To achieve this, we rephrase MCQs as text-completion scenarios with a determined set of outcomes and compare the model's next-token probability assignments to the true likelihood of the outcomes. In line with previous work, we find that models exhibit solid performance in their explicit probabilistic reasoning (i.e., answers to MCQs). However, during text completion (i.e., implicit probabilistic reasoning), where the same information must be taken into account to generate text, the models' predictions often significantly diverge from the known ground truth. For instance, our evaluation method reveals that implicit probabilistic reasoning is improperly influenced by many factors, such as independent prior events, partial observations about a result, or statistical background information. All of these issues can cause erroneous results to be produced in text generation, which are not detected by conventional MCQ-based evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

Despite this advantage, their application to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this limitation, we present DiffuTester, an acceleration framework specifically tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The motivation of DiffuTester is that unit tests targeting the same focal method often share structural patterns. DiffuTester employs a novel structural pattern based decoding approach, which dynamically identifies structural patterns across unit tests through their abstract syntax trees and additionally decodes the corresponding tokens, thereby achieving acceleration without compromising the quality of the output. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark to three programming languages. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffuTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffuTester generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development.

However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench. Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> | Accepted by TMLR |

Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.</p></details> |  |

In transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling coefficient $γ$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model. However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a static scaling factor $γ$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input, thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent, self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency, SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026, 32 pages, 14 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Gauss-Newton Unlearning for the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10568v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 16pages, 10 figures |

However, their sequential autoregressive decoding forces inherently parallel clinical reasoning, such as differential diagnosis, into a single linear reasoning path, limiting both efficiency and reliability for complex medical problems. To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%. Compared to specialized medical LLMs, MedVerse achieves comparable performance while delivering a 1.3x reduction in inference latency and a 1.7x increase in generation throughput, enabled by its parallel decoding capability.

However, it remains a challenge to apply LLMs to complex clinical decision-making, which requires a deep understanding of medical knowledge and differs from the standardized, exam-style scenarios commonly used in current efforts. A common approach is to fine-tune LLMs for target tasks, which, however, not only requires substantial data and computational resources but also remains prone to generating `hallucinations'. In this work, we present RiskAgent, which synergizes language models with hundreds of validated clinical decision tools supported by evidence-based medicine, to provide generalizable and faithful recommendations. Our experiments show that RiskAgent not only achieves superior performance on a broad range of clinical risk predictions across diverse scenarios and diseases, but also demonstrates robust generalization in tool learning on the external MedCalc-Bench dataset, as well as in medical reasoning and question answering on three representative benchmarks, MedQA, MedMCQA, and MMLU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Data are available at https://github.com/AI-in-Health/RiskAgent</p></details> |
| **[MedCoG: Maximizing LLM Inference Density in Medical Reasoning via Meta-Cognitive Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07905v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in complex medical reasoning yet face diminishing gains under inference scaling laws. While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework that probes fine-grained clinical understanding through controlled counterfactuals. Using intensive care unit (ICU) discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, we construct both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) variants with single-variable perturbations in demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate eight LLMs, spanning general-purpose and medical variants, under zero-shot setting. Model behavior is analyzed through (1) input-level sensitivity, capturing how counterfactuals alter perplexity, and (2) downstream reasoning, measuring their effect on predicted ICU length-of-stay and mortality. Overall, our results show that standard task metrics obscure clinically relevant differences in model behavior, with models differing substantially in how consistently and proportionally they adjust predictions to counterfactual perturbations.</p></details> |  |

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus "find it but fail to use it," leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHRWorld: A Patient-Centric Medical World Model for Long-Horizon Clinical Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03569v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (including appendix), 11 figures</p></details> |

However, the influence of endorsement source credibility remains underexplored. We investigate whether language models exhibit systematic bias based on the perceived expertise of the provider of the endorsement. Across 4 datasets spanning mathematical, legal, and medical reasoning, we evaluate 11 models using personas representing four expertise levels per domain. Our results reveal that models are increasingly susceptible to incorrect/misleading endorsements as source expertise increases, with higher-authority sources inducing not only accuracy degradation but also increased confidence in wrong answers. We also show that this authority bias is mechanistically encoded within the model and a model can be steered away from the bias, thereby improving its performance even when an expert gives a misleading endorsement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Medical Reasoning Verification via Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20221v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy with dynamic entropy regulation, progressively teaching the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 23.6% over strong baselines.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks. By incorporating calibrated reasoning into a single model, RareAlert enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and scalable rare disease risk screening suitable for large-scale local deployment.</p></details> | 28 page, 3 figures |
| **[HeartLLM: Discretized ECG Tokenization for LLM-Based Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography (ECG) plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present HeartLLM, a novel framework that integrates time-series (TS) and language modeling by enabling large language models (LLMs) to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into quantized codes using a lead-wise encoder and quantization module. These quantized codes are then mapped to an extended ECG vocabulary to form ECG tokens, enabling the model to process both ECG and natural language inputs within a unified framework. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG token forecasting task, allowing the LLM to capture temporal dynamics through its inherent language modeling capability. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, HeartLLM achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating discretized ECG tokens into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Medical LLMs: Benchmarking and Enhancing Confidence Estimation of Large Language Models in Medical Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15645v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.</p></details> |  |

We address this by first introducing CUREMED-BENCH, a high-quality multilingual medical reasoning dataset with open-ended reasoning queries with a single verifiable answer, spanning thirteen languages, including underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Swahili. Building on this dataset, we propose CURE-MED, a curriculum-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates code-switching-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization to jointly improve logical correctness and language stability. Across thirteen languages, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines and scales effectively, achieving 85.21% language consistency and 54.35% logical correctness at 7B parameters, and 94.96% language consistency and 70.04% logical correctness at 32B parameters. These results support reliable and equitable multilingual medical reasoning in LLMs. The code and dataset are available at https://cure-med.github.io/</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-CoReasoner, a language-informed co-reasoning framework that elicits parallel English and local-language reasoning, abstracts them into structured concepts, and integrates local clinical knowledge into an English logical scaffold via concept-level alignment and retrieval. This design combines the structural robustness of English reasoning with the practice-grounded expertise encoded in local languages. To evaluate multilingual medical reasoning beyond multiple-choice settings, we construct MultiMed-X, a benchmark covering seven languages with expert-annotated long-form question answering and natural language inference tasks, comprising 350 instances per language. Experiments across three benchmarks show that Med-CoReasoner improves multilingual reasoning performance by an average of 5%, with particularly substantial gains in low-resource languages. Moreover, model distillation and expert evaluation analysis further confirm that Med-CoReasoner produces clinically sound and culturally grounded reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAGE: Scaling Test-Time Inference with Parallel Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18260v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Here, we asked whether advances in reasoning LLMs improve their cognitive flexibility in clinical reasoning. We assessed reasoning models from the OpenAI, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek families on the medicine abstraction and reasoning corpus (mARC), an adversarial medical QA benchmark which utilizes the Einstellung effect to induce inflexible overreliance on learned heuristic patterns in contexts where they become suboptimal. We found that strong reasoning models avoided Einstellung-based traps more often than weaker reasoning models, achieving human-level performance on mARC. On questions most commonly missed by physicians, the top 5 performing models answered 55% to 70% correctly with high confidence, indicating that these models may be less susceptible than humans to Einstellung effects. Our results indicate that strong reasoning models demonstrate improved flexibility in medical reasoning, achieving performance on par with humans on mARC.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewarding the Rare: Uniqueness-Aware RL for Creative Problem Solving in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08763v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Incentivizing Cardiologist-Like Reasoning in MLLMs for Interpretable Echocardiographic Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08440v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MEDVISTAGYM: A Scalable Training Environment for Thinking with Medical Images via Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07107v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on general image understanding but struggle to think with medical images, especially when performing multi-step reasoning through iterative visual interaction. Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Across six medical VQA benchmarks, MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21%, demonstrating that structured agentic training--not tool access alone--unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v5)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing approaches remain constrained by their derivative nature, relying on real-world records, which pose privacy risks and distribution biases. Furthermore, current patient agents face the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma, struggling to maintain clinical consistency during dynamic inquiries. To address these challenges, we introduce Patient-Zero, a novel framework for ab initio patient simulation that requires no real medical records. Our Medically-Aligned Hierarchical Synthesis framework generates comprehensive and diverse patient records from abstract clinical guidelines via stratified attribute permutation. To support rigorous clinical interaction, we design a Dual-Track Cognitive Memory System to enable agents dynamically update memory while preserving logical consistency and persona adherence. Extensive evaluations show that Patient-Zero establishes a new state-of-the-art in both data quality and interaction fidelity. In human expert evaluations, senior licensed physicians judge our synthetic data to be statistically indistinguishable from real human-authored data and higher in clinical quality. Furthermore, downstream medical reasoning model trained on our synthetic dataset shows substantial performance gains (MedQA +24.0%; MMLU +14.5%), demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Robustness of Answer Formats in Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning models (MRMs) achieve superior performance on medical benchmarks compared to medical LLMs; however, high accuracy alone is insufficient for practical deployment. One of such requirements for real-world application is robustness to varying output constraints. Specifically, posing the same medical question while requesting different answer formats should not affect the underlying correctness of the response. We investigate this phenomenon in this paper, focusing on MRMs. To quantify this behavior, we propose the metric answer-format robustness: the ability to reliably generate correct outputs across varying specified formats. We examine three representative formats: multiple-choice, open-ended question-answering, and ranked lists. Across 15 proprietary and open-weight models, we observe substantial variation in format robustness (35-100%). Furthermore, we conduct controlled fine-tuning experiments on a shared backbone with matched training data to isolate the effects of the fine-tuning paradigm. We find that supervised fine-tuning yields more stable behavior across formats, whereas reinforcement fine-tuning often exhibits higher cross-format brittleness, with the degree of instability strongly dependent on reward design. Overall, answer-format robustness in MRMs is trainable yet brittle and requires careful evaluation for practical medical use.</p></details> | 62 pages, 47 figures |

This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Machine Learning and Deep Learning (JMLDL). 9 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Anatomy-R1: Enhancing Anatomy Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models via Anatomical Similarity Curriculum and Group Diversity Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19512v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12140v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.</p></details> |  |

Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods. Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Asilomar Conference</p></details> |
| **[MedCEG: Reinforcing Verifiable Medical Reasoning with Critical Evidence Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13510v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models with reasoning capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of domains. In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality. Experimental results show that MedCEG surpasses existing methods in performance while producing clinically valid reasoning chains, representing a solid advancement in reliable medical AI reasoning.

Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems. The complete source code and datasets used in this study are available at https://github.com/souravbasakshuvo/DL3M.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-REFL: Medical Reasoning Enhancement via Self-Corrected Fine-grained Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13793v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models excel in domains like mathematics where intermediate reasoning is straightforward to verify, but struggle to self-correct in medicine fields where evaluating intermediate reasoning is cumbersome and expensive. This verification bottleneck hinders the development of reliable AI reasoners for high-stakes application. Here we propose Med-REFL, a novel framework that learns fine-grained reflection without human labels or model distillation. Med-REFL introduces a deterministic structural assessment of the reasoning space to automatically generate preference data for reflection. By globally evaluating all explored reasoning paths in a tree-of-thoughts, our method quantifies the value of corrective actions, enabling the automated construction of direct preference optimization pairs. This trains the model to recognize and amend its own reasoning fallacies. Extensive experiments show Med-REFL delivers robust gains across diverse models architectures and medical benchmarks, boosting a general-purpose Llama3.1-8B by +5.82% and the state-of-the-art Huatuo-o1 by +4.13% on the MedQA benchmark. Our Med-REFL-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-8B models while even competing with models twice its size. Crucially, targeted ablations prove its success generalizes to other domains such as logical reasoning and mitigates the `fake reflection' phenomenon in LRMs. Ultimately, our framework provides a scalable solution to the verification bottleneck, paving the way for more reliable AI reasoners in high-stakes domains like medicine. Med-REFL has been made publicly available in https://github.com/TianYin123/Med-REFL.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | AAAI2026 |

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03838v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.</p></details> |  |

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  |

Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI-26 (ORAL)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01450v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms baseline methods, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling.

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Hallucinations in Foundation Models and Their Impact on Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05777v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in foundation models arise from autoregressive training objectives that prioritize token-likelihood optimization over epistemic accuracy, fostering overconfidence and poorly calibrated uncertainty. We define medical hallucination as any model-generated output that is factually incorrect, logically inconsistent, or unsupported by authoritative clinical evidence in ways that could alter clinical decisions. We evaluated 11 foundation models (7 general-purpose, 4 medical-specialized) across seven medical hallucination tasks spanning medical reasoning and biomedical information retrieval. General-purpose models achieved significantly higher proportions of hallucination-free responses than medical-specialized models (median: 76.6% vs 51.3%, difference = 25.2%, 95% CI: 18.7-31.3%, Mann-Whitney U = 27.0, p = 0.012, rank-biserial r = -0.64). Top-performing models such as Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 97% accuracy when augmented with chain-of-thought prompting (base: 87.6%), while medical-specialized models like MedGemma ranged from 28.6-61.9% despite explicit training on medical corpora. Chain-of-thought reasoning significantly reduced hallucinations in 86.4% of tested comparisons after FDR correction (q < 0.05), demonstrating that explicit reasoning traces enable self-verification and error detection. Physician audits confirmed that 64-72% of residual hallucinations stemmed from causal or temporal reasoning failures rather than knowledge gaps. A global survey of clinicians (n = 70) validated real-world impact: 91.8% had encountered medical hallucinations, and 84.7% considered them capable of causing patient harm. The underperformance of medical-specialized models despite domain training indicates that safety emerges from sophisticated reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge integration developed during large-scale pre-training, not from narrow optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedRECT: A Medical Reasoning Benchmark for Error Correction in Clinical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00421v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Role Cognition in Medical LLMs via Neuronal Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24677v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems, particularly in the context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP), instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the related code in the following repository:https: //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[S-Chain: Structured Visual Chain-of-Thought For Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22728v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16 languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability. Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med, LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity, and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning, improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and explainable medical VLMs.</p></details> | First version |

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective. Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Reasoning-with-Retrieval Framework for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18303v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[BenCao: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17415v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triplet-Structured Knowledge Integration for Multi-Turn Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03536v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.</p></details> | Preprint |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60% compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |

Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.</p></details> |  |

However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process, limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge. In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$ constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the model.

Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02669v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d</p></details> |

The challenge focuses on developing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models that answer clinically relevant questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing interpretable justifications aligned with medical reasoning. It introduces two subtasks: (1) answering diverse types of visual questions using the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, and (2) generating multimodal explanations to support clinical decision-making. The Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, created from 6,500 images and 159,549 complex question-answer (QA) pairs, serves as the benchmark for the challenge. By combining quantitative performance metrics and expert-reviewed explainability assessments, this task aims to advance trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis.

| **[MedAtlas: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Round, Multi-Task Medical Reasoning Across Diverse Imaging Modalities and Clinical Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10947v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.26% and +26.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</p></details> | Corrected some typos |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCoT: Communication-Efficient Federated Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10020v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover, existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.</p></details> |  |

This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning.

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lingshu: A Generalist Foundation Model for Unified Multimodal Medical Understanding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07044v4)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

| **[Kvasir-VQA-x1: A Multimodal Dataset for Medical Reasoning and Robust MedVQA in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09958v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

| **[MedXpertQA: Benchmarking Expert-Level Medical Reasoning and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18362v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

| **[WiNGPT-3.0 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17387v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |
| **[RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02830v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025 (main track)</p></details> |

While recent innovations have led to specialized models for various CXR interpretation tasks, these solutions often operate in isolation, limiting their practical utility in clinical practice. We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories. Our experiments demonstrate that MedRAX achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both open-source and proprietary models, representing a significant step toward the practical deployment of automated CXR interpretation systems.

| **[Experience Retrieval-Augmentation with Electronic Health Records Enables Accurate Discharge QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17933v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively applied to provide factual medical knowledge. However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
