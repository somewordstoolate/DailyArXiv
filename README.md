| **[Open Source Planning & Control System with Language Agents for Autonomous Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07257v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent (https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent). The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted contribution to the ICML 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics.

| **[Text2BIM: Generating Building Models Using a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08054v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. The code is available at: https://github.com/dcy0577/Text2BIM</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering</p></details> |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Retrieval of Topics and Insights from Earnings Calls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07906v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve, traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2nd Workshop on Financial Information Retrieval in the Era of Generative AI, The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval July 13-17, 2025 | Padua, Italy</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLM Agent Adherence to Hierarchical Safety Principles: A Lightweight Benchmark for Probing Foundational Controllability Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02357v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a high-level safety principle when faced with conflicting task instructions. Our evaluation of six LLMs reveals two primary findings: (1) a quantifiable "cost of compliance" where safety constraints degrade task performance even when compliant solutions exist, and (2) an "illusion of compliance" where high adherence often masks task incompetence rather than principled choice. These findings provide initial evidence that while LLMs can be influenced by hierarchical directives, current approaches lack the consistency required for reliable safety governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[The Future is Agentic: Definitions, Perspectives, and Open Challenges of Multi-Agent Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02097v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of recommender systems. We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration. We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance. For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters optimization approaches for Warm-Start Particles Swarm Optimization with Crossover and Mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algorithm, designed for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication, are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and improvable performance. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first set up via a profile, which specifies the boundary of hyper-parameters, task objective, terminal condition, conservative or aggressive strategy of optimizing hyper-parameters, and LLM configurations. Then, the LLM agent iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent exits the loop based on the terminal condition and returns an optimized set of hyperparameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO and WS-PSO-CM algorithm knowledge is useful in seeking high-performance hyper-parameters.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvestAlign: Overcoming Data Scarcity in Aligning Large Language Models with Investor Decision-Making Processes under Herd Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06528v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/thu-social-network-research-group/InvestAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHADE-Arena: Evaluating Sabotage and Monitoring in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15740v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging AI and Software Security: A Comparative Vulnerability Assessment of LLM Agent Deployment Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06323v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250 attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection. Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure deployment. Code and experimental materials are available at https: // github. com/ theconsciouslab-ai/llm-agent-security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Too Human to Model:The Uncanny Valley of LLMs in Social Simulation -- When Generative Language Agents Misalign with Modelling Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06310v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents Are All You Need for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00406v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate Strategies to Enhance Requirements Engineering with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05981v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are becoming widely used for various Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks. Research on improving their accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and collaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method: We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various domains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE classification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE classification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving LLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECom-Bench: Can LLM Agent Resolve Real-World E-commerce Customer Support Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05639v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce ECom-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating LLM agent with multimodal capabilities in the e-commerce customer support domain. ECom-Bench features dynamic user simulation based on persona information collected from real e-commerce customer interactions and a realistic task dataset derived from authentic e-commerce dialogues. These tasks, covering a wide range of business scenarios, are designed to reflect real-world complexities, making ECom-Bench highly challenging. For instance, even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only a 10-20% pass^3 metric in our benchmark, highlighting the substantial difficulties posed by complex e-commerce scenarios. Upon publication, the code and data will be open-sourced to facilitate further research and development in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs are Introvert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05638v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods, including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes, emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16658v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis. Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains.

| **[Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration.

However, their capabilities remain constrained in complex, multimodal scenarios. We present MindFlow, the first open-source multimodal LLM agent tailored for e-commerce. Built on the CoALA framework, it integrates memory, decision-making, and action modules, and adopts a modular "MLLM-as-Tool" strategy for effect visual-textual reasoning. Evaluated via online A/B testing and simulation-based ablation, MindFlow demonstrates substantial gains in handling complex queries, improving user satisfaction, and reducing operational costs, with a 93.53% relative improvement observed in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Personalized Multi-Turn Dialogue with Curiosity Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03206v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanMind: Towards Urban General Intelligence via Tool-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multilevel Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04706v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI. Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future urban environments.</p></details> |  |

LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

Existing works rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own") KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers, reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.</p></details> |  |

This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment, focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a framework of gamified personality assessment through multi-personality representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models to empower virtual agents with diverse personalities. These agents elicit multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the interaction, it achieves two ways of personality assessments (i.e., Direct Assessment and Que-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights. Grounded in the classic Big Five theory, we implemented a prototype system and conducted a user study to assess the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance when considering the multiplicity of personality representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |
| **[GRAFT: A Graph-based Flow-aware Agentic Framework for Document-level Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03311v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise, they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation. To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework. Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate translations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Demo Track</p></details> |

Among these, LLM email agent apps represent one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources, allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness. To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all 1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops to as few as 1.23.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRAgent-R1: Boosting Video Recommendation with MLLM-based Agents via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02626v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to powerful natural language processing and generative capabilities, large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing recommendation systems via user simulation. However, in the realm of video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US) Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10 on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\% higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision-Oriented Text Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01923v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy. We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM) decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of traditional intrinsic metrics.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts to evaluate the scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

As these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments, we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model, and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension, complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents (MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential challenges they may face.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JMS(March 2025)</p></details> |

While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.</p></details> |  |

CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings, Source code: https://github.com/HahmDY/causal_influence_prompting.git</p></details> |

Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows, encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban intelligence.

| **[Generative Exaggeration in LLM Social Agents: Consistency, Bias, and Toxicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00657v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on 1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini, Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative simulations, and policy modeling.</p></details> |  |

While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACL 2025 SRW</p></details> |

Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.</p></details> |  |

Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation, focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns. Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print version - paper actually under submission</p></details> |

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

| **[From Prompt Injections to Protocol Exploits: Threats in LLM-Powered AI Agents Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23260v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration. Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains: Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies), System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora. Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 17 figures.

| **[RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition, there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability. RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions. RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[L2MAC: Large Language Model Automatic Computer for Extensive Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02003v6)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed context window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their ability to produce long and coherent outputs. Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann architecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and consistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We empirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming other coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show that L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as writing an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's performance improvement over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

| **[Automated detection of atomicity violations in large-scale systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00521v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs pose a significant threat to software safety in critical systems. These violations occur when the execution sequence of operations on shared resources is disrupted by asynchronous interrupts. Detecting atomicity violations is challenging due to the vast program state space, application-level code dependencies, and complex domain-specific knowledge. We propose Clover, a hybrid framework that integrates static analysis with large language model (LLM) agents to detect atomicity violations in real-world programs. Clover first performs static analysis to extract critical code snippets and operation information. It then initiates a multi-agent process, where the expert agent leverages domain-specific knowledge to detect atomicity violations, which are subsequently validated by the judge agent. Evaluations on RaceBench 2.1, SV-COMP, and RWIP demonstrate that Clover achieves a precision/recall of 92.3%/86.6%, outperforming existing approaches by 27.4-118.2% on F1-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design Patterns for Securing LLM Agents against Prompt Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Vulnerable than You Think: On the Stability of Tool-Integrated LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21967v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Powered Agent for C to Rust Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15858v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The C programming language has been foundational in building system-level software. However, its manual memory management model frequently leads to memory safety issues. In response, a modern system programming language, Rust, has emerged as a memory-safe alternative. Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust translation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities of LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. Despite some success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs to static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic problem-solving capability. Applying the LLM agentic capability for the C-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from the traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains. First, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of suitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning. Second, unlike math or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not well-defined. Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these intermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory. To address these challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate step, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning framework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R). The VFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors between an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate informative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code. LAC2R uses the MCTS to systematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct translation. We experimentally demonstrated that LAC2R effectively conducts C-to-Rust translation on large-scale, real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doppelganger Method: Breaking Role Consistency in LLM Agent via Prompt-based Transferable Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14539v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelganger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelganger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelganger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (main manuscript without references), 2 figures</p></details> |

Current robustness evaluations often rely on unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Poste...</summary><p>Poster accepted at the 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P 2025)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios. These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities</p></details> |  |

However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer.</p></details> |  |

However, joint evolution across heterogeneous agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities. Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander (e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models, serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and 11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks when handling untrusted data. In this paper we propose CaMeL, a robust defense that creates a protective system layer around the LLM, securing it even when underlying models are susceptible to attacks. To operate, CaMeL explicitly extracts the control and data flows from the (trusted) query; therefore, the untrusted data retrieved by the LLM can never impact the program flow. To further improve security, CaMeL uses a notion of a capability to prevent the exfiltration of private data over unauthorized data flows by enforcing security policies when tools are called. We demonstrate effectiveness of CaMeL by solving $77\%$ of tasks with provable security (compared to $84\%$ with an undefended system) in AgentDojo. We release CaMeL at https://github.com/google-research/camel-prompt-injection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with newer models and link to the code</p></details> |

We introduce MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools, MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth. This work establishes active tool discovery as a fundamental design pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems.</p></details> |  |

This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the data curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances. To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation. We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces AgenticControl, a novel multi-agent framework that automates controller design using coordinated Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Through structured JSON communication, these agents handle tasks including controller selection, scenario design, parameter optimization, performance evaluation, and decision-making. Through an actor-critic optimization approach, the system iteratively improves performance while progressing through scenarios of increasing complexity to ensure robustness under nominal conditions, measurement noise, actuator disturbances, and parametric uncertainties. Key innovations include structured multi-agent collaboration, robust optimization mechanisms, and real-time adaptability via in-context learning. Validated across four diverse control systems, namely, DC Motor Position control, Ball and Beam, Inverted Pendulum, and Double Inverted Pendulum, the framework achieves competitive performance against classical methods. Its Full State Feedback solution closely matches Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) results, while the designed PID controller significantly outperforming MATLAB's PIDTuner, reducing PID tracking error by 55% through adaptive parameter exploration. A comparative study of five LLM models reveals distinct optimization profiles, with DeepSeek achieving the fastest convergence. This work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven control design, paving the way for advanced techniques like model predictive control and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04365v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.06\pm15.3$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score. Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical question-answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 4th Muslims in Machine Learning (MusIML) Workshop (ICML-25)</p></details> |

We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at https://camp-lab-purdue.github.io/bayesian-social-deduction/</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 10 figures.

However, they can generate inaccurate patches. Little is known about the root causes behind those failed patches or how those could be fixed. This paper reports an empirical study of the failed patches generated by seven top LLM code agents. We collected 114 issues from the SWE-bench Lite dataset that remained unresolved across the agents. The seven agents produced a total of 769 failed patches for those issues, which we checked with a combination of GPT-4o and manual analysis. We present a taxonomy of the failure reasons across the patches. The taxonomy contains six categories, with several sub-categories under each category. For example, a frequently observed category is the inability of an LLM to correctly infer/produce the appropriate variable type in the produced patch. As a first step towards addressing such type-related errors, we designed PAGENT (Patch Agent). PAGENT utilizes program analysis techniques like CFG creation and exploration to infer the type of information of a patch. PAGENT does this by applying repository-level static code analysis techniques. Then, PAGENT refines the inferred type by further utilizing an LLM-based inference technique. We tested PAGENT on all 127 type-related failed patches from the top three agents in our study. PAGENT could fix 29 of the 127 failed patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of AI Agent Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16736v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Infrastructures, represented by Deep Learning (DL) frameworks, have served as fundamental DL systems over the last decade. However, the bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in some critical scenarios (e.g., healthcare and autonomous driving). A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Unfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered multiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a coarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to whether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only focus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to analyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test cases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven fuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents, namely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates tests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed, and 5 assigned with CVE IDs. Our work indicates that considering multiple types of feedback is beneficial to fuzzing performance, and leveraging LLMs to analyze feedback information is a promising direction.

This process demands skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools, highlighting the need for a more intelligent, streamlined VA approach. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been developed as agents to handle various tasks with dynamic planning and tool-using capabilities, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency and versatility of VA. We propose LightVA, a lightweight VA framework that supports task decomposition, data analysis, and interactive exploration through human-agent collaboration. Our method is designed to help users progressively translate high-level analytical goals into low-level tasks, producing visualizations and deriving insights. Specifically, we introduce an LLM agent-based task planning and execution strategy, employing a recursive process involving a planner, executor, and controller. The planner is responsible for recommending and decomposing tasks, the executor handles task execution, including data analysis, visualization generation and multi-view composition, and the controller coordinates the interaction between the planner and executor. Building on the framework, we develop a system with a hybrid user interface that includes a task flow diagram for monitoring and managing the task planning process, a visualization panel for interactive data exploration, and a chat view for guiding the model through natural language instructions. We examine the effectiveness of our method through a usage scenario and an expert study.</p></details> |  |

We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of Foundation Models: Opportunities, Challenges and Futures</p></details> |

However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent. OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency. Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3% on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios, e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g., AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp, including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

This results in narrow applicability and low utility. In this paper, we introduce AssistantX, an LLM-powered proactive assistant designed for autonomous operation in realworld scenarios with high accuracy. AssistantX employs a multi-agent framework consisting of 4 specialized LLM agents, each dedicated to perception, planning, decision-making, and reflective review, facilitating advanced inference capabilities and comprehensive collaboration awareness, much like a human assistant by your side. We built a dataset of 210 real-world tasks to validate AssistantX, which includes instruction content and status information on whether relevant personnel are available. Extensive experiments were conducted in both text-based simulations and a real office environment over the course of a month and a half. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that AssistantX can reactively respond to user instructions, actively adjust strategies to adapt to contingencies, and proactively seek assistance from humans to ensure successful task completion.

However, their capability in the fundamental yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research. It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to autonomously reproduce scientific research</p></details> |  |

While LLMs offer significant technological progress, their development using vast amounts of user data scraped from the web and collected from extensive user interactions poses risks of sensitive information leakage. Most existing surveys focus on the privacy implications of the training data but tend to overlook privacy risks from user interactions and advanced LLM capabilities. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of privacy in LLMs, categorizing the challenges into four main areas: (i) privacy issues in LLM training data, (ii) privacy challenges associated with user prompts, (iii) privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-generated outputs, and (iv) privacy challenges involving LLM agents. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of existing mitigation mechanisms targeting these proposed privacy challenges and identify areas for further research.</p></details> |  |

To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agents for Bargaining with Utility-based Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22998v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized). We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |

If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paten...</summary><p>PatentSemTech@SIGIR2025</p></details> |

To address the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80 test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational framework for future security research.

| **[Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04686v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various domains like open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve strategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic decision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often suffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited exploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages the observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the underlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form utterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted extensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the learned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents progressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the strategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf agents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with strategic interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2025</p></details> |

To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Their increasing agency and expanding deployment settings attract growing attention to effective governance policies, monitoring, and control protocols. Based on the emerging landscape of the agentic market, we analyze potential liability issues arising from the delegated use of LLM agents and their extended systems through a principal-agent perspective. Our analysis complements existing risk-based studies on artificial agency and covers the spectrum of important aspects of the principal-agent relationship and their potential consequences at deployment. Furthermore, we motivate method developments for technical governance along the directions of interpretability and behavior evaluations, reward and conflict management, and the mitigation of misalignment and misconduct through principled engineering of detection and fail-safe mechanisms. By illustrating the outstanding issues in AI liability for LLM-based agentic systems, we aim to inform the system design, auditing, and tracing to enhance transparency and liability attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (incl. appendix), accepted at REALM workshop, ACL2025</p></details> |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic evaluation of their complex reasoning ability within spatial contexts remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises nearly 1K video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene and captured by video. By carefully designing questions and corresponding 3D scenes, our benchmark ensures that solving the questions requires both spatial comprehension for extracting information and high-level reasoning for deriving solutions, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine. This engine, leveraging multiple specialized LLM agents, can generate realistic 3D scenes from abstract math problems, ensuring faithfulness to the original descriptions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 10 pages,3 figures |

This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and $\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs. We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets, authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature. Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate ($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts, elucidating the deficiencies of medical ethics alignment.

| **[MAM: Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis via Role-Specialized Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19835v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17163v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeVisE: Behavioral Testing of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15339v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors.

Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention due to its features of rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, existing medical RAG frameworks still have shortcomings. Most existing medical RAG frameworks are designed for single-round question answering tasks and are not suitable for multi-round diagnostic dialogue. On the other hand, existing medical multi-round RAG frameworks do not consider the interconnections between potential diseases to inquire precisely like a doctor. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the doctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis information of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis like a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we conduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese medicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different methods. The results indicate that our RAG framework can significantly enhance the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of our approach in medical diagnosis. The code and data can be found in our project website https://github.com/YixiangCh/MRD-RAG/tree/master.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation.

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment.

| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patient-Level Anatomy Meets Scanning-Level Physics: Personalized Federated Low-Dose CT Denoising Empowered by Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00908v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing radiation doses benefits patients, however, the resultant low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images often suffer from clinically unacceptable noise and artifacts. While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Democratizing Medical LLMs for 50 Languages via a Mixture of Language Family Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10626v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting medical Large Language Models to local languages can reduce barriers to accessing healthcare services, but data scarcity remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications.

Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field.

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1).

However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

| **[One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08794v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data at https://huggingface.co/sarosavo/Master-RM and https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarosavo/Master-RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockFFN: Towards End-Side Acceleration-Friendly Mixture-of-Experts with Chunk-Level Activation Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08771v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. The review includes all types of original research, regardless of peer-review status, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023. Studies were included without language restrictions if they employed LLMs developed after T5 and directly investigated research questions within mental health care settings. Results: Out of an initial 313 articles, 34 were selected based on their relevance to LLMs applications in mental health care and the rigor of their reported outcomes. The review identified various LLMs applications in mental health care, including diagnostics, therapy, and enhancing patient engagement. Key challenges highlighted were related to data availability and reliability, the nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. While LLMs showed promise in improving accuracy and accessibility, significant gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion: LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[KG-Attention: Knowledge Graph-Guided Attention at Test-Time via Bidirectional Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08704v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism. By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable knowledge fusion performance of KGA.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByDeWay: Boost Your multimodal LLM with DEpth prompting in a Training-Free Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08679v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

However, these methods still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs), a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic. Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets.

| **[Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end, we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought (INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt. Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM, which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified, with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines. Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification experiments.</p></details> |  |

Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially, verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors, allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions, together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by 3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set.

| **[DatasetAgent: A Novel Multi-Agent System for Auto-Constructing Datasets from Real-World Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08648v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted contribution to the ICML 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics.

This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause clinical harm.

One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |

While batching is commonly used to increase throughput, performance gains plateau beyond a certain batch size, especially with smaller models, a phenomenon that existing literature typically explains as a shift to the compute-bound regime. In this paper, through an in-depth GPU-level analysis, we reveal that large-batch inference remains memory-bound, with most GPU compute capabilities underutilized due to DRAM bandwidth saturation as the primary bottleneck. To address this, we propose a Batching Configuration Advisor (BCA) that optimizes memory allocation, reducing GPU memory requirements with minimal impact on throughput. The freed memory and underutilized GPU compute capabilities can then be leveraged by concurrent workloads. Specifically, we use model replication to improve serving throughput and GPU utilization. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions about LLM inference, offering new insights and practical strategies for improving resource utilization, particularly for smaller language models.

We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[AgentsNet: Coordination and Collaborative Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08616v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier models in a setup with up to 100 agents.</p></details> | Preprint |

Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets, previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets. Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting, increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and context-related abilities.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

| **[Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Semantic Description Generation with MLLMs for Image-Text Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08590v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete, structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers. By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME2025 oral</p></details> |

While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Multi-modal Model Cartographic Map Comprehension for Textual Locality Georeferencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08575v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps. Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this method into a georeferencing workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[AbbIE: Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder for Efficient Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08567v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture, which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2 iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods. AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\% improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on model sizes up to 350M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages and 6 figures. Submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based framework featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link Prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we construct SpiceNetlist, a comprehensive dataset that contains 775 annotated circuits across 10 different component classes. Experiments demonstrate accuracy improvements of 16.08% on SpiceNetlist, 11.38% on Image2Net, and 16.01% on Masala-CHAI compared to the baseline in intra-dataset evaluation, while maintaining accuracy from 92.05% to 99.07% in cross-dataset evaluation, exhibiting robust feature transfer capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data will be made available on request.

We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the AI Language Proficiency Monitor, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark that systematically assesses LLM performance across up to 200 languages, with a particular focus on low-resource languages. Our benchmark aggregates diverse tasks including translation, question answering, math, and reasoning, using datasets such as FLORES+, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and ARC. We provide an open-source, auto-updating leaderboard and dashboard that supports researchers, developers, and policymakers in identifying strengths and gaps in model performance. In addition to ranking models, the platform offers descriptive insights such as a global proficiency map and trends over time. By complementing and extending prior multilingual benchmarks, our work aims to foster transparency, inclusivity, and progress in multilingual AI.

We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 10 pages,3 figures |
| **[An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Formula Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10657v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of NAACL</p></details> |
| **[InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via ICL-oriented Prefix Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08523v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences. Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multimodal LLMs by Large-Scale 3D Visual Instruction Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08513v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint, and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose duplicating response tokens along with a custom attention mask to enable single-pass processing of entire conversations. We prove our method produces identical losses to the N-pass approach while reducing time complexity from $O\bigl(N^{3}\bigl)$ to $O\bigl(N^{2}\bigl)$ and maintaining the same memory complexity for a transformer based model. Our approach achieves significant training speedup while preserving accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://weihaotan.github.io/StarDojo</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages. Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86% in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the superior text mining alternative.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use.

One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version, v3, added the missing name of x-axis in the left part of Fig.1 and corrected a wrong number in Fig.3.

In tax consulting practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured background information.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score, misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

These conferences often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work, we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops across various domains.</p></details> |  |

Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 2nd LLM+Graph Workshop, colocated at VLDB'25</p></details> |

We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the context of interdisciplinary studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Inclusive Systematic Reviews: Incorporating Preprint Articles with Large Language Model-Driven Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13857v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Systematic reviews in comparative effectiveness research require timely evidence synthesis. Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but vary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews. Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an advanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance on manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key advancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing techniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large language model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two prediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival cure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time. Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article usage metrics. The survival cure model reached AUROC 0.716 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.731 with semantic embeddings. For publication risk prediction, it achieved a concordance index of 0.658, increasing to 0.667 with semantic embeddings. Conclusion. Our study advances the framework for preprint publication prediction through automated data extraction and multiple feature integration. By combining semantic embeddings with LLM-driven evaluations, AutoConfidence enhances predictive performance while reducing manual annotation burden. The framework has the potential to facilitate incorporation of preprint articles during the appraisal phase of systematic reviews, supporting researchers in more effective utilization of preprint resources.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08410v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2) prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after publication.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GTR: Guided Thought Reinforcement Prevents Thought Collapse in RL-based VLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08525v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.</p></details> |  |

Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models: Toward Elderly Driver Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08367v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density, assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition. These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection. Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0% (multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments. Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Machine Learning and Enhanced Parallelism Detection for BPMN Model Generation from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08362v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based, still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel structures in process descriptions. This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset, which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets. This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has shown that structured dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents, and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation.

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Efficient Long Context Fine-tuning with Chunk Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02356v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long context fine-tuning of large language models(LLMs) involves training on datasets that are predominantly composed of short sequences and a small proportion of longer sequences. However, existing approaches overlook this long-tail distribution and employ training strategies designed specifically for long sequences. Moreover, these approaches also fail to address the challenges posed by variable sequence lengths during distributed training, such as load imbalance in data parallelism and severe pipeline bubbles in pipeline parallelism. These issues lead to suboptimal training performance and poor GPU resource utilization. To tackle these problems, we propose a chunk-centric training method named ChunkFlow. ChunkFlow reorganizes input sequences into uniformly sized chunks by consolidating short sequences and splitting longer ones. This approach achieves optimal computational efficiency and balance among training inputs. Additionally, ChunkFlow incorporates a state-aware chunk scheduling mechanism to ensure that the peak memory usage during training is primarily determined by the chunk size rather than the maximum sequence length in the dataset. Integrating this scheduling mechanism with existing pipeline scheduling algorithms further enhances the performance of distributed training. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with Megatron-LM, ChunkFlow can be up to 4.53x faster in the long context fine-tuning of LLMs. Furthermore, we believe that ChunkFlow serves as an effective solution for a broader range of scenarios, such as long context continual pre-training, where datasets contain variable-length sequences.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |

While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229 objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions, particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p></details> | 31pages, 14 figures |

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development.

Despite significant advancements in general VQA, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still exhibit substantial limitations when handling multi-task VQA scenarios. These limitations manifest through erroneous spatial localization and misinterpretation of medical images, which primarily arise from two fundamental issues: inadequate image-text alignment and insufficient domain-specified knowledge for medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce the Cross-Modal Clinical Knowledge Distiller (ClinKD), an innovative framework designed to enhance image-text alignment and establish more effective medical knowledge transformation mechanisms, which enables MLLMs to perform better even when lacking prior medical knowledge. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the ClinKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets which are challenging for Med-VQA task. The results indicate that our approach not only significantly improves image-text alignment but also effectively enables MLLMs to adapt to the medical knowledge. The source code for ClinKD is available at: https://github.com/overloadedHenry/ClinKD.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bandit-Based Prompt Design Strategy Selection Improves Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01163v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results. Our experimental code is provided at https://github.com/shiralab/OPTS .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Dualformer: Controllable Fast and Slow Thinking by Learning with Randomized Reasoning Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09918v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cognition theory, human thinking is governed by two systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but more deliberative System 2. Analogously, Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate in two reasoning modes: outputting only the solutions (\emph{fast mode}) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (\emph{slow mode}). We present \dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes by training on randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are strategically dropped during training. At inference time, \dualformer can be easily configured to execute in either fast or slow mode, or automatically decide which mode to engage (\emph{auto mode}). It outperforms baselines in both performance and computational efficiency across all three modes: (1) in slow mode, \dualformer achieves $97.6\%$ optimal rate on unseen $30 \times 30$ maze tasks, surpassing the \searchformer baseline ($93.3\%$) trained on data with complete reasoning traces, with $45.5\%$ fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, \dualformer achieves $80\%$ optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model trained on solution-only data, which has an optimal rate of only $30\%$; (3) in auto mode, \dualformer achieves $96.6\%$ optimal rate with $59.9\%$ fewer steps than \searchformer. Moreover, \dualformer produces more diverse reasoning traces than \searchformer{}. For math reasoning problems, our techniques have also achieved improved performance with LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its generalization beyond task-specific models. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/dualformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[QUEST: Query Optimization in Unstructured Document Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06515v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs) powered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents like working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting attributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations constitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high monetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the query optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query execution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To fill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization strategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an index-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With this index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target attributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an evidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing relevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution strategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly document by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents. For each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute extraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies and an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of QUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lambert-x.github.io/Vision-Language-Vision/</p></details> |
| **[Invariant-based Robust Weights Watermark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08288v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning, quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01403v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW2025 |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Two-Stage Recipe for Mathematical LLMs: Maximizing Accuracy with SFT and Efficiency with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08267v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on The second AI for MATH</p></details> |

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex, non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advantages, concerns arise regarding the potential risk of privacy leaks, particularly in scenarios involving social interactions. While existing research has focused on protecting privacy by limiting the access of AI delegates to sensitive user information, many social scenarios require disclosing private details to achieve desired social goals, necessitating a balance between privacy protection and disclosure. To address this challenge, we first conduct a pilot study to investigate user perceptions of AI delegates across various social relations and task scenarios, and then propose a novel AI delegate system that enables privacy-conscious self-disclosure. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed AI delegate strategically protects privacy, pioneering its use in diverse and dynamic social interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources. In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly enhance classifier performance.</p></details> |  |

Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding). On the GSM8K and HumanEval datasets, our method achieves a 2.26x speedup (9.4% improvement) and 2.23x speedup (11.1% improvement), respectively.

Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.</p></details> |  |

We propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy) drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM, fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations, receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise, actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets (Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and mitigating energy inefficiencies.</p></details> |  |

However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 20th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA), co-located with ACL 2025</p></details> |

Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning. SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms. Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality, execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Available: https://github.com/chan0park/SelfReVision</p></details> |

This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the Books3 dataset from 17 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from different LLMs. This is evidence that these LLMs have memorized the extracted text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't memorize most books--either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and 1984, almost entirely. In fact, Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first line of chapter 1, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effect of Static vs. Conversational AI-Generated Messages on Colorectal Cancer Screening Intent: a Randomized Controlled Trial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08211v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) chatbots show increasing promise in persuasive communication. Yet their real-world utility remains uncertain, particularly in clinical settings where sustained conversations are difficult to scale. In a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 915 U.S. adults (ages 45-75) who had never completed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Participants were randomized to: (1) no message control, (2) expert-written patient materials, (3) single AI-generated message, or (4) a motivational interviewing chatbot. All participants were required to remain in their assigned condition for at least three minutes. Both AI arms tailored content using participant's self-reported demographics including age and gender. Both AI interventions significantly increased stool test intentions by over 12 points (12.9-13.8/100), compared to a 7.5 gain for expert materials (p<.001 for all comparisons). While the AI arms outperformed the no message control for colonoscopy intent, neither showed improvement xover expert materials. Notably, for both outcomes, the chatbot did not outperform the single AI message in boosting intent despite participants spending ~3.5 minutes more on average engaging with it. These findings suggest concise, demographically tailored AI messages may offer a more scalable and clinically viable path to health behavior change than more complex conversational agents and generic time intensive expert-written materials. Moreover, LLMs appear more persuasive for lesser-known and less-invasive screening approaches like stool testing, but may be less effective for entrenched preferences like colonoscopy. Future work should examine which facets of personalization drive behavior change, whether integrating structural supports can translate these modest intent gains into completed screenings, and which health behaviors are most responsive to AI-supported guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space, with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.</p></details> |  |

Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods, TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g., black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type (self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM</p></details> |  |

Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge components via long-range correlations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Automating Expert-Level Medical Reasoning Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07988v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2T-CoT: From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought for Medical Reasoning and Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19610v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal techniques have led to significant progress in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-REFL: Medical Reasoning Enhancement via Self-Corrected Fine-grained Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13793v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models have recently made significant strides in mathematical and code reasoning, yet their success has not transferred smoothly to the medical domain. While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications. Checkpoints, code, and data can be found in https://github.com/TianYin123/Med-REFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedTVT-R1: A Multimodal LLM Empowering Medical Reasoning and Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18512v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/keke-nice/MedTVT-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

| **[Med-U1: Incentivizing Unified Medical Reasoning in LLMs via Large-scale Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12307v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeVisE: Behavioral Testing of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15339v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[InsertRank: LLMs can reason over BM25 scores to Improve Listwise Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14086v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant strides across various information retrieval tasks, particularly as rerankers, owing to their strong generalization and knowledge-transfer capabilities acquired from extensive pretraining. In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is critical in medicine, where identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50% using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using small-scale models of 8 billion parameters.

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

To address this, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner} to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

| **[PersianMedQA: Language-Centric Evaluation of LLMs in the Persian Medical Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025 (main track)</p></details> |

However, their practical deployment faces critical challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories.

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based agents in medicine, examining their architectures, applications, and challenges. We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Reasoning with Curriculum-Aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19213v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

A 3D Medical Benchmark for Tumor-centric Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18915v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark: https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 datasets&benchmarks track submission</p></details> |

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy.

Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets.

We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization.

However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |

The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

| **[Towards Conversational AI for Disease Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06074v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Structured Outputs Enable General-Purpose LLMs to be Medical Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03194v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question-answering (QA) is a critical task for evaluating how effectively large language models (LLMs) encode clinical knowledge and assessing their potential applications in medicine. Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Citrus: Leveraging Expert Cognitive Pathways in a Medical Language Model for Advanced Medical Decision Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18274v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities, have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential across a wide range of applications. However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedS$^3$: Towards Medical Small Language Models with Self-Evolved Slow Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12051v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical language models (MLMs) have become pivotal in advancing medical natural language processing. However, prior models that rely on pre-training or supervised fine-tuning often exhibit low data efficiency and limited practicality in real-world clinical applications. While OpenAI's o1 highlights test-time scaling in mathematics, attempts to replicate this approach in medicine typically distill responses from GPT-series models to open-source models, focusing primarily on multiple-choice tasks. This strategy, though straightforward, neglects critical concerns like data privacy and realistic deployment in clinical settings. In this work, we present a deployable, small-scale medical reasoning system, MedS3, designed for long-chain reasoning in clinical tasks using a self-evolution paradigm. Starting with a seed dataset of around 8,000 instances spanning five domains and 16 datasets, we prompt a base policy model to perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct rule-verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the process reward model (PRM). During inference, the policy model generates multiple responses, and the reward model selects the one with a newly proposed PRM-guided Vote-Sum (P-VS) strategy. Experiments on eleven evaluation datasets demonstrate that MedS3 outperforms not only the prior strongest medical model by 6.59, but also 32B-level general reasoning models by 8.71 points.

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating background information and detailed guidance in addressing complex zero-shot Med-VQA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |

While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |

This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities.

| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance. Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, Under Review</p></details> |
| **[From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01040v3)** | 2024-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by doctors' underlying reasoning process, we present Diagnostic-Reasoning CoT (DR-CoT). Empirical results demonstrate that by simply prompting large language models trained only on general text corpus with two DR-CoT exemplars, the diagnostic accuracy improves by 15% comparing to standard prompting. Moreover, the gap reaches a pronounced 18% in out-domain settings. Our findings suggest expert-knowledge reasoning in large language models can be elicited through proper promptings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Tiny Paper at ICLR 2023 (10 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05410v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

| **[Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375v2)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |

For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases. A detailed discussion is also provided at the end of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information (ISSN 2078-2489)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07285v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2021 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results in models with a clearer structure.</p></details> |  |

It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at AAAMAS 2019</p></details> |
