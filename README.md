| **[RECODE-H: A Benchmark for Research Code Development with Interactive Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06186v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at github.com/ChunyuMiao98/RECODE</p></details> |
| **[EU-Agent-Bench: Measuring Illegal Behavior of LLM Agents Under EU Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21524v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn and multilingual interactions. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/ilijalichkovski/eu-agent-bench}{this URL}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Regulatable ML at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MLRC-Bench: Can Language Agents Solve Machine Learning Research Challenges?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09702v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions, with a focus on open research problems that demand novel methodologies. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist, which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, designed to grow with new ML competitions and encourage rigorous, objective evaluations of AI research capabilities. Our leaderboard and code are available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch/MLRC_Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[DRIFT: Dynamic Rule-Based Defense with Injection Isolation for Securing LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12104v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly central to agentic systems due to their strong reasoning and planning capabilities. By interacting with external environments through predefined tools, these agents can carry out complex user tasks. Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo and ASB benchmark, demonstrating its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse models, showcasing both its robustness and adaptability. The code is released at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/DRIFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Soft Instruction De-escalation Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21057v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAI3: Testing Agent Integrity in Interpreting User Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07524v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce TAI3, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, TAI3 generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, TAI3 maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that TAI3 effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, TAI3 generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23946v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[BuildArena: A Physics-Aligned Interactive Benchmark of LLMs for Engineering Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16559v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

| **[ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments. To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut. As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Cooperation in LLM-Agent Societies: A Preliminary Study Using Different Punishment Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19487v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the Diner's Dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for presentation as a full paper at the COINE 2025 workshop at AAMAS 2025 (https://coin-workshop.github.io/coine-2025-detroit/accepted_for_presentation.html)</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Merge and Conquer: Evolutionarily Optimizing AI for 2048](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20205v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Reinforcing Multi-Turn Reasoning in LLM Agents via Turn-Level Reward Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11821v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in long-horizon, multi-turn scenarios. Although RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have been widely applied to train multi-turn LLM agents, they typically rely only on sparse outcome rewards and lack dense intermediate signals across multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on complex reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study of \textit{turn-level reward design} for multi-turn RL algorithms and agent applications. By integrating turn-level rewards, we extend GRPO and PPO to their respective multi-turn variants, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. We conduct case studies on multi-turn reasoning-augmented search agents, where we carefully design two types of turn-level rewards: verifiable and LLM-as-judge. Our experiments on multi-turn search tasks demonstrate that incorporating well-designed turn-level rewards enables RL algorithms to significantly outperform baseline methods with trajectory-level rewards. Both training and validation reward curves illustrate that our method achieves \textit{greater stability}, \textit{faster convergence}, and \textit{higher accuracy}. Numerical results across diverse question-answering datasets further show that our approach consistently delivers highest answer correctness and 100\% format correctness.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Human-Centered LLM-Agent System for Detecting Anomalous Digital Asset Transactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20102v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection, and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop, dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial forensics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Safety Standard Same for Everyone? User-Specific Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15086v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the use of large language model (LLM) agents continues to grow, their safety vulnerabilities have become increasingly evident. Extensive benchmarks evaluate various aspects of LLM safety by defining the safety relying heavily on general standards, overlooking user-specific standards. However, safety standards for LLM may vary based on a user-specific profiles rather than being universally consistent across all users. This raises a critical research question: Do LLM agents act safely when considering user-specific safety standards? Despite its importance for safe LLM use, no benchmark datasets currently exist to evaluate the user-specific safety of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce U-SafeBench, a benchmark designed to assess user-specific aspect of LLM safety. Our evaluation of 20 widely used LLMs reveals current LLMs fail to act safely when considering user-specific safety standards, marking a new discovery in this field. To address this vulnerability, we propose a simple remedy based on chain-of-thought, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user-specific safety. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/U-SafeBench.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[ToolScope: Enhancing LLM Agent Tool Use through Tool Merging and Context-Aware Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20036v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy. LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly, inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a 24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models, particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Measuring Data Science Automation: A Survey of Evaluation Tools for AI Assistants and Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08800v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 10/2025 https://openreview.net/forum?id=MB0TCLfLn1</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Reactivity: Measuring Proactive Problem Solving in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19771v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEC-bench: Automated Benchmarking of LLM Agents on Real-World Software Security Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11791v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench, we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19687v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under ACL Rolling Review 2025</p></details> |

We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Coopetition: Leveraging Coarse Verifier Signals for Resilient Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18179v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AdCo-Research/adaptive-coopetition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Evaluating Medical LLMs by Levels of Autonomy: A Survey Moving from Benchmarks to Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17764v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks; however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.</p></details> |  |
| **[CURE: Confidence-driven Unified Reasoning Ensemble Framework for Medical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14353v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical Exams -- Dataset Construction and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11517v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-granularity Concept Sparse Activation and Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework for Rare Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08529v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p></details> | 12 pages,3 figures |
| **[End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

| **[ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critique of Impure Reason: Unveiling the reasoning behaviour of medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15748v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

In this work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3) self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances. Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code.

While current DNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful explanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret and reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically coherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based disease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant effect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines. BioReason can reason over unseen biological entities and explain its decisions step by step, offering a transformative framework for interpretable, mechanistic AI in biology.

To uncover the principles that govern their behaviour, we introduce the Electronic Circuit Principles (ECP), which maps inference-time learning (ITL) onto a semantic electromotive force and inference-time reasoning (ITR) onto a resistive network governed by Ohm's and Faraday's laws. This circuit-based modelling yields closed-form predictions of task performance and reveals how modular prompt components interact to shape accuracy. We validated ECP on 70,000 samples spanning 350 reasoning tasks and 9 advanced LLMs, observing a about 60% improvement in Pearson correlation relative to the conventional inference-time scaling law. Moreover, ECP explains the efficacy of 15 established prompting strategies and directs the development of new modular interventions that exceed the median score of the top 80% of participants in both the International Olympiad in Informatics and the International Mathematical Olympiad. By grounding LLM reasoning in electronic-circuit principles, ECP provides a rigorous framework for predicting performance and optimising modular components.</p></details> | Manuscript |

Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems. Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy. Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</p></details> |  |

Existing accounts, from classical logic to probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track), that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space. We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Retention analysis of edited knowledge after fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14198v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that knowledge retention can be significantly improved by either augmenting edit knowledge with paraphrases or by freezing layers associated with edited content in fine-tuning stage, offering insight for developing more robust editing algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Narrow Gate: Localized Image-Text Communication in Native Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06646v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</p></details> |  |

They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance, matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/metauto-ai/HGM.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective. Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Reasoning-with-Retrieval Framework for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18303v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[BenCao: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17415v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triplet-Structured Knowledge Integration for Multi-Turn Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03536v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.</p></details> | Preprint |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential.

This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60% compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedLA: A Logic-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23725v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedCritical: Enhancing Medical Reasoning in Small Language Models via Self-Collaborative Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23368v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.</p></details> |  |
