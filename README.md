| **[PersonaAgent with GraphRAG: Community-Aware Knowledge Graphs for Personalized LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17467v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PersonaAgentwGraphRAG-DE6F</p></details> |  |
| **[REMSA: An LLM Agent for Foundation Model Selection in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17442v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/be-chen/REMSA</p></details> |
| **[Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that LIVE-SWE-AGENT can achieve an impressive solve rate of 77.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing software agents, including the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17330v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generated code is gaining traction recently, owing to the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Further, the AlphaProof initiative has demonstrated the possibility of using AI for general mathematical reasoning. Reasoning about computer programs (software) can be accomplished via general mathematical reasoning; however, it tends to be more structured and richer in contexts. This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI. In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree. Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA): Designing a Deceptively Human AI Facilitator for Group Chats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17315v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics. We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Platonic Representations for Poverty Mapping: Unified Vision-Language Codes or Agent-Induced Novelty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01109v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[CodeWiki: Evaluating AI's Ability to Generate Holistic Documentation for Large-Scale Codebases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24428v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a large and evolving codebase, the ability to automatically generate holistic, architecture-aware documentation that captures not only individual functions but also cross-file, cross-module, and system-level interactions remains an open challenge. Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term software maintenance and collaboration, yet current automated approaches still fail to model the rich semantic dependencies and architectural structures that define real-world software systems. We present \textbf{CodeWiki}, a unified framework for automated repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki introduces three key innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context across multiple levels of granularity, (ii) recursive multi-agent processing with dynamic task delegation for scalable generation, and (iii) multi-modal synthesis that integrates textual descriptions with visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data-flow representations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce \textbf{CodeWikiBench}, a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-dimensional rubrics and LLM-based assessment protocols. Experimental results show that CodeWiki achieves a 68.79\% quality score with proprietary models, outperforming the closed-source DeepWiki baseline (64.06\%) by 4.73\%, with particularly strong improvements on high-level scripting languages (+10.47\%). We open-source CodeWiki to foster future research and community adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Design of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agent Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse sources, there is a growing demand for sophisticated AI systems capable of intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture, resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that establishes a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives, developed and evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF). Our framework clearly distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, which plays the role of central coordinator. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security -- the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five architecture variants of our framework by designing new agent architectures that combine characteristics of state-of-the-art agents to address specific goals. ...</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables.

| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Designing Domain-Specific Agents via Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17198v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://earth-insights.github.io/EarthAgent</p></details> |
| **[AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Belief-Desire-Intention Ontology for modelling mental reality and agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17162v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Language Model Agents Whistleblow?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17085v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Debate Improves Corporate Credit Reasoning in Financial AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17108v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 2 algorithms, 2 tables, 4 appendices</p></details> |
| **[PathAgent: Toward Interpretable Analysis of Whole-slide Pathology Images via Large Language Model-based Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17052v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GhostEI-Bench: Do Mobile Agents Resilience to Environmental Injection in Dynamic On-Device Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20333v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-Aware Tool-Use Enables Effective Agent Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17006v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MirrorMind: Empowering OmniScientist with the Expert Perspectives and Collective Knowledge of Human Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16997v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ToC: Tree-of-Claims Search with Multi-Agent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16972v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing patent claims is a critical yet challenging task, demanding careful balance between maximizing novelty and preserving legal scope. Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing PyTorch Inference with LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16964v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.</p></details> |  |
| **[SALT: Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking in Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniScientist: Toward a Co-evolving Ecosystem of Human and AI Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16931v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-DSE: Searching Accelerator Parameters with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12188v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of programming domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) by raising the abstraction level, optimizing hardware directive parameters remains a significant hurdle. Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency. We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057v5)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can AI based methods help us make advances in complexity theory? We provide evidence towards answering this in the affirmative, using AlphaEvolve (an LLM code mutation agent) to obtain new results in three settings: a) We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ vertices, and our upper bounds are obtained via analytical arguments. b) We obtain new inapproximability results for MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate them within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP (rather than a reduction from ``standard'' Håstad-style PCPs). c) Inapproximability for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum cost tour within a factor of $111/110$ using AlphaEvolve to discover a new gadget, thus improving the SOTA of $117/116$. Along the way, we provide new modular soundness and completeness arguments that can be of independent interest. A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (sometimes requiring time exponential in the size of the construction). We used AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$ for our gadgets). Our results suggest that gadget based proofs would benefit from a pass through AI-based tools to obtain stronger results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Small Math Model: Recasting Strategy Choice Theory in an LLM-Inspired Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24068v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategy Choice Theory (SCT; Siegler and Shrager, 1984; Siegler, 2000) explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data, probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies. AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy formalization: a novel cross-LLM voting mechanism to guarantee confidence of the parsed privacy policy model. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates data practices based on the AI agent's context and the privacy policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology graphs and automata-based checking connect the privacy policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checking. (iv) User interface: an infrastructure-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy policy violations, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability. We evaluate AudAgent with AI agents built using mainstream frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and visualizing privacy policy violations in real time. Using AudAgent, we also find that most privacy policies omit explicit safeguards for highly sensitive data such as SSNs, whose misuse violates legal requirements, and that many agents do not refuse handling such data via third-party tools, including those controlled by Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AudAgent proactively blocks operations on such data, overriding the agents' original privacy policy and behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust in AI emerges from distrust in humans: A machine learning study on decision-making guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16769v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the dynamics of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) agents, particularly large language models (LLMs), by introducing the concept of "deferred trust", a cognitive mechanism where distrust in human agents redirects reliance toward AI perceived as more neutral or competent. Drawing on frameworks from social psychology and technology acceptance models, the research addresses gaps in user-centric factors influencing AI trust. Fifty-five undergraduate students participated in an experiment involving 30 decision-making scenarios (factual, emotional, moral), selecting from AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT), voice assistants, peers, adults, or priests as guides. Data were analyzed using K-Modes and K-Means clustering for patterns, and XGBoost models with SHAP interpretations to predict AI selection based on sociodemographic and prior trust variables. Results showed adults (35.05\%) and AI (28.29\%) as the most selected agents overall. Clustering revealed context-specific preferences: AI dominated factual scenarios, while humans prevailed in social/moral ones. Lower prior trust in human agents (priests, peers, adults) consistently predicted higher AI selection, supporting deferred trust as a compensatory transfer. Participant profiles with higher AI trust were distinguished by human distrust, lower technology use, and higher socioeconomic status. Models demonstrated consistent performance (e.g., average precision up to 0.863). Findings challenge traditional models like TAM/UTAUT, emphasizing relational and epistemic dimensions in AI trust. They highlight risks of over-reliance due to fluency effects and underscore the need for transparency to calibrate vigilance. Limitations include sample homogeneity and static scenarios; future work should incorporate diverse populations and multimodal data to refine deferred trust across contexts.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Securing Smart Contract Languages with a Unified Agentic Framework for Vulnerability Repair in Solidity and Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18515v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the blockchain ecosystem and the increasing value locked in smart contracts necessitate robust security measures. While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets. This work offers a detailed analysis of various LLMs' performance on smart contract repair, highlighting the strengths of our multi-agent approach and providing a blueprint for developing more secure and reliable decentralized applications in the growing blockchain landscape. We also provide a detailed recipe for extending this to other similar use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSwift: Efficient LLM Agent Design via Value-guided Hierarchical Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06017v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across diverse domains, yet automated agent design remains a significant challenge. Current automated agent design approaches are often constrained by limited search spaces that primarily optimize workflows but fail to integrate crucial human-designed components like memory, planning, and tool use. Furthermore, these methods are hampered by high evaluation costs, as evaluating even a single new agent on a benchmark can require tens of dollars. The difficulty of this exploration is further exacerbated by inefficient search strategies that struggle to navigate the large design space effectively, making the discovery of novel agents a slow and resource-intensive process. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSwift, a novel framework for automated agent design. We formalize a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components. This structure moves beyond optimizing workflows alone by co-optimizing functional components, which enables the discovery of more complex and effective agent architectures. To make exploration within this expansive space feasible, we mitigate high evaluation costs by training a value model on a high-quality dataset, generated via a novel strategy combining combinatorial coverage and balanced Bayesian sampling for low-cost evaluation. Guiding the entire process is a hierarchical MCTS strategy, which is informed by uncertainty to efficiently navigate the search space. Evaluated across a comprehensive set of seven benchmarks spanning embodied, math, web, tool, and game domains, AgentSwift discovers agents that achieve an average performance gain of 8.34\% over both existing automated agent search methods and manually designed agents. Our framework serves as a launchpad for researchers to rapidly discover powerful agent architectures.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |

We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the AAAI-26 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |
| **[Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12115v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits. Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 32% to 53%, even surpassing the performance of o1-preview. In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Agent-Based Framework for the Automatic Validation of Mathematical Optimization Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16383v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **["To Survive, I Must Defect": Jailbreaking LLMs via the Game-Theory Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16278v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture "template-over-safety flip": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges. This paper presents our vision of AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles - developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users - each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems - not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker. Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination" issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 40 references</p></details> |

This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 tables |

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

| **[OEMA: Ontology-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15211v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of unstructured clinical texts in electronic health records (EHRs), clinical named entity recognition (NER) has become a crucial technique for extracting medical information. However, traditional supervised models such as CRF and BioClinicalBERT suffer from high annotation costs. Although zero-shot NER based on large language models (LLMs) reduces the dependency on labeled data, challenges remain in aligning example selection with task granularity and effectively integrating prompt design with self-improvement frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose OEMA, a novel zero-shot clinical NER framework based on multi-agent collaboration. OEMA consists of three core components: (1) a self-annotator that autonomously generates candidate examples; (2) a discriminator that leverages SNOMED CT to filter token-level examples by clinical relevance; and (3) a predictor that incorporates entity-type descriptions to enhance inference accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MTSamples and VAERS, demonstrate that OEMA achieves state-of-the-art performance under exact-match evaluation. Moreover, under related-match criteria, OEMA performs comparably to the supervised BioClinicalBERT model while significantly outperforming the traditional CRF method. OEMA improves zero-shot clinical NER, achieving near-supervised performance under related-match criteria. Future work will focus on continual learning and open-domain adaptation to expand its applicability in clinical NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \textit{Bias Recommendation}, \textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work. All code, datasets, and experimental configurations will be merged into our primary repository at https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Multi-Agent Code Verification with Compound Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16708v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench "solved" patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy. Testing on 300 real patches from Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs in under 200ms per sample, making this practical for production use.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables.

Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative.

Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[TOD-ProcBench: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following in Task-Oriented Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15976v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.</p></details> |  |
| **[JudgeBoard: Benchmarking and Enhancing Small Language Models for Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15958v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

AccelOpt explores the kernel optimization space through iterative generation, informed by an optimization memory that curates experiences and insights from previously encountered slow-fast kernel pairs. We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.</p></details> |  |

Traditional world models based on deep learning demand vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date, application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World) synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of the agent's gameplay at https://topwasu.github.io/poe-world.</p></details> |  |

Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, Accepted to the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026), IAAI Deployed Applications Track</p></details> |

Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Workshop on WoMAPF</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.</p></details> | Written in 2025 Q1 |

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,9 figures.

Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data.

| **[Cost-Aware Prediction (CAP): An LLM-Enhanced Machine Learning Pipeline and Decision Support System for Heart Failure Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15357v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability. This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, traffic regulations are complex, context-dependent, and differ between regions, posing a major challenge to conventional rule-based decision-making approaches. We present an interpretable, regulation-aware decision-making framework, DriveReg, which enables autonomous vehicles to understand and adhere to region-specific traffic laws and safety guidelines. The framework integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Traffic Regulation Retrieval Agent, which retrieves relevant rules from regulatory documents based on the current situation, and a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Reasoning Agent that evaluates actions for legal compliance and safety. Our design emphasizes interpretability to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce the DriveReg Scenarios Dataset, a comprehensive dataset of driving scenarios across Boston, Singapore, and Los Angeles, with both hypothesized text-based cases and real-world driving data, constructed and annotated to evaluate models' capacity for regulation understanding and reasoning. We validate our framework on the DriveReg Scenarios Dataset and real-world deployment, demonstrating strong performance and robustness across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assemble Your Crew: Automatic Multi-agent Communication Topology Design via Autoregressive Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18224v4)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and establishes the optimal communication links between them. This generative approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner, precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of ARG-Designer is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/ARG-Designer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral presentation by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept. Finally, we summarize open challenges and future research directions toward building trustworthy, quantum-resilient, and adaptive GenAI-enabled 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Taxonomy, Evaluation and Exploitation of IPI-Centric LLM Agent Defense Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15203v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with function-calling capabilities are increasingly deployed, but remain vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks that hijack their tool calls. In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.</p></details> |  |

SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents. SOLID offers a promising framework for advancing automated and intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 WORKSHOP ML*OR Workshop: Mathematical Foundations and Operational Integration of Machine Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Decision-Making</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Diverse Perspectives: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15791v5)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs are widely used in industrial applications, making error detection crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. Existing error detection methods often fail to effectively utilize fine-grained subgraph information and rely solely on fixed graph structures, while also lacking transparency in their decision-making processes, which results in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent framework for Knowledge Graph Error Detection (MAKGED) that utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative setting. By concatenating fine-grained, bidirectional subgraph embeddings with LLM-based query embeddings during training, our framework integrates these representations to produce four specialized agents. These agents utilize subgraph information from different dimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error detection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG evaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the training of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error detection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our framework.

| **[Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15755v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 tables |
| **[Build AI Assistants using Large Language Models and Agents to Enhance the Engineering Education of Biomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15752v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedBench v4: A Robust and Scalable Benchmark for Evaluating Chinese Medical Language Models, Multimodal Models, and Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14439v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedLA: A Logic-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23725v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI-26 (ORAL)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Automatic Feature Extraction via Collaborative Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15074v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a "flooding-pruning" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, in review</p></details> |
| **[Beyond GeneGPT: A Multi-Agent Architecture with Open-Source LLMs for Enhanced Genomic Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15061v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization. In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution. OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures.

However, as tasks become increasingly complex, these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover, graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap, showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource. We will release the dataset and code publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing systems prioritize numerical scoring accuracy over feedback quality and are primarily evaluated on pre-secondary school level writing. This paper presents Multi-Agent Argumentation and Grammar Integrated Critiquer (MAGIC), a framework using five specialized agents to evaluate prompt adherence, persuasiveness, organization, vocabulary, and grammar for both holistic scoring and detailed feedback generation. To support evaluation at the college level, we collated a dataset of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) practice essays with expert-evaluated scores and feedback. MAGIC achieves substantial to near-perfect scoring agreement with humans on the GRE data, outperforming baseline LLM models while providing enhanced interpretability through its multi-agent approach. We also compare MAGIC's feedback generation capabilities against ground truth human feedback and baseline models, finding that MAGIC achieves strong feedback quality and naturalness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into EAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted in MICCAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[AutoTool: Efficient Tool Selection for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14650v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026, 18 pages, 11 figures, Code: https://github.com/jiajingyyyyyy/AutoTool</p></details> |
| **[Model Editing as a Double-Edged Sword: Steering Agent Ethical Behavior Toward Beneficence or Harm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20606v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks. Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce harmful or malicious behavior. Through extensive evaluations of agents built on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench validates the effectiveness of behavior editing across a wide range of models and scenarios.

| **[MiroThinker: Pushing the Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Research Agents via Model, Context, and Interactive Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11793v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.</p></details> | Technical Report |

To automate this process, researchers have made substantial progress for code generation. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in function-level code generation, yet their performance significantly degrades in the real-world software development process, where coding tasks are deeply embedded within specific repository contexts. Existing studies attempt to use retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) approaches to mitigate this demand. However, there is a gap between natural language (NL) requirements and programming implementations. This results in the failure to retrieve the relevant code of these fine-grained subtasks. To address this challenge, we propose GraphCodeAgent, a dual graph-guided LLM agent for retrieval-augmented repo-level code generation, bridging the gap between NL requirements and programming implementations. Our approach constructs two interconnected graphs: a Requirement Graph (RG) to model requirement relations of code snippets within the repository, as well as the relations between the target requirement and the requirements of these code snippets, and a Structural-Semantic Code Graph (SSCG) to capture the repository's intricate code dependencies. Guided by this, an LLM-powered agent performs multi-hop reasoning to systematically retrieve all context code snippets, including implicit and explicit code snippets, even if they are not explicitly expressed in requirements. We evaluated GraphCodeAgent on three advanced LLMs with the two widely-used repo-level code generation benchmarks DevEval and CoderEval. Extensive experiment results show that GraphCodeAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflexGrad: Three-Way Synergistic Architecture for Zero-Shot Generalization in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14584v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[O-Mem: Omni Memory System for Personalized, Long Horizon, Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13593v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.67% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper serves as the technical report of the Agent-R1 project</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.</p></details> |  |

The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 Table.

However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniDebugger: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Unified Software Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17153v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software debugging is a time-consuming endeavor involving a series of steps, such as fault localization and patch generation, each requiring thorough analysis and a deep understanding of the underlying logic. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising potential in coding tasks, their performance in debugging remains limited. Current LLM-based methods often focus on isolated steps and struggle with complex bugs. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework, FixAgent, for unified debugging through multi-agent synergy. It mimics the entire cognitive processes of developers, with each agent specialized as a particular component of this process rather than mirroring the actions of an independent expert as in previous multi-agent systems. Agents are coordinated through a three-level design, following a cognitive model of debugging, allowing adaptive handling of bugs with varying complexities. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that FixAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art repair methods, fixing 1.25$\times$ to 2.56$\times$ bugs on the repo-level benchmark, Defects4J. This performance is achieved without requiring ground-truth root-cause code statements, unlike the baselines.

However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by HSSCOMMS'25</p></details> |

These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPRO: Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization for Enhancing Medical QA and Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00974v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO distinguishes itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns model outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley--Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA, MedQA-USMLE, and a real-world clinical dataset from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 2B-parameter model outperforms much larger 7B--20B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement provides a scalable and clinically grounded approach to building more reliable medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2025 (WS#44: Biological ontologies and knowledge bases (BiOK) in the LLM era)</p></details> |

To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

Existing medical image datasets either simply overlooked the nuance and polarise into binary label. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly mine medical reports to utilise the uncertainty relevant expression for supervision signal. At first, we collect uncertainty keywords from medical reports. Then, we use Qwen-3 4B to identify the textual uncertainty and map them into an adaptive Generalized Label Smoothing (GLS) rate. This rate allows our model to treat uncertain labels not as errors, but as informative signals, effectively incorporating expert skepticism into the training process. We establish a new clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark to rigorously evaluate this problem. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical disease detection. The curated uncertainty words database, code, and benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OEMA: Ontology-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15211v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of unstructured clinical texts in electronic health records (EHRs), clinical named entity recognition (NER) has become a crucial technique for extracting medical information. However, traditional supervised models such as CRF and BioClinicalBERT suffer from high annotation costs. Although zero-shot NER based on large language models (LLMs) reduces the dependency on labeled data, challenges remain in aligning example selection with task granularity and effectively integrating prompt design with self-improvement frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose OEMA, a novel zero-shot clinical NER framework based on multi-agent collaboration. OEMA consists of three core components: (1) a self-annotator that autonomously generates candidate examples; (2) a discriminator that leverages SNOMED CT to filter token-level examples by clinical relevance; and (3) a predictor that incorporates entity-type descriptions to enhance inference accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MTSamples and VAERS, demonstrate that OEMA achieves state-of-the-art performance under exact-match evaluation. Moreover, under related-match criteria, OEMA performs comparably to the supervised BioClinicalBERT model while significantly outperforming the traditional CRF method. OEMA improves zero-shot clinical NER, achieving near-supervised performance under related-match criteria. Future work will focus on continual learning and open-domain adaptation to expand its applicability in clinical NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning.

| **[Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Fairshare Data Pricing via Data Valuation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00198v4)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data is the backbone of large language models (LLMs), yet today's data markets often operate under exploitative pricing -- sourcing data from marginalized groups with little pay or recognition. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions between buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with theoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives high-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term model performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in data valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives by sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and sellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal outcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining market participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP tasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning, fairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality data, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our findings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically sustainable data markets for LLM.</p></details> |  |

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI-26 (ORAL)</p></details> |

Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior, caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized LLaVA-based multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) by introducing a unified visual latent space with pre-alignment to facilitate visual question answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB) medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: 7th International Workshop on Large Scale Holistic Video Understanding: Toward Video Foundation Models</p></details> |

Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures.

However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, but showed improvements when provided examples through few shot prompting. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Medical Reasoning with Minimal Fine-Tuning Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01450v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms baseline methods, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mihara-bot/DIQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted in MICCAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present DIVER, a retrieval pipeline designed for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. It consists of four components. The document preprocessing stage enhances readability and preserves content by cleaning noisy texts and segmenting long documents. The query expansion stage leverages large language models to iteratively refine user queries with explicit reasoning and evidence from retrieved documents. The retrieval stage employs a model fine-tuned on synthetic data spanning medical and mathematical domains, along with hard negatives, enabling effective handling of reasoning-intensive queries. Finally, the reranking stage combines pointwise and listwise strategies to produce both fine-grained and globally consistent rankings. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 46.8 overall and 31.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13381v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel hierarchical method that combines selective Optimal Transport (OT) alignment for attention layers with cosine similarity-weighted interpolation, designed to address permutation variance while minimizing computational overhead for edge deployment scenarios. Our study evaluates Task Arithmetic, Linear Averaging, DARE-TIES, DELLA, Breadcrumbs, and our Hierarchical approach across five medical benchmarks. Results demonstrate that architecturally compatible models benefit significantly from simple averaging methods, with Task Arithmetic achieving 45.80% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming complex pruning-based approaches. These findings offer critical insights for the deployment of distributed medical AI in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational efficiency and model compatibility are paramount. Our work establishes that for architecturally compatible models, simple averaging provides a robust and computationally efficient baseline for knowledge consolidation, offering a pragmatic path forward for scalable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MedFact, a challenging Chinese medical fact-checking benchmark with 2,116 expert-annotated instances from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 specialties, 8 error types, 4 writing styles, and 5 difficulty levels. Construction uses a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert feedback refines AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering to ensure high quality and difficulty. We evaluate 20 leading LLMs on veracity classification and error localization, and results show models often determine if text contains errors but struggle to localize them precisely, with top performers falling short of human performance. Our analysis reveals the "over-criticism" phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify correct information as erroneous, which can be exacerbated by advanced reasoning techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. MedFact highlights the challenges of deploying medical LLMs and provides resources to develop factually reliable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026-AIA and designated as an oral presentation paper</p></details> |

Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI'26</p></details> |

However, these methods deteriorate in open-ended domains like medical consultation, where feedback is inherently ambiguous, highly context-dependent, and cannot be reduced to a reliable scalar signal. In such settings, RL must either rely on supervision-intensive reward models that often fail to generalize, or it falls into pathological behaviors such as reward hacking - an especially troubling risk for high-stakes medical dialogue. To address these limitations, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates synthetic dialogue generation with dynamically constructed rubrics that serve as adaptive guides for incremental RL. Instead of relying on external medical knowledge bases or handcrafted rule sets, ORBIT uses rubric-driven feedback to steer the learning process. Its judge component can be instantiated with general-purpose instruction-following LLMs, removing the need for any task-specific fine-tuning. Applied to the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, ORBIT raises the HealthBench-Hard score from 7.0 to 27.5 using only 2k training samples, achieving SOTA performance for models at this scale. With larger rubric datasets, ORBIT-trained models further compete with the strongest open-source baselines on HealthBench-Hard. Our analysis shows that rubric-guided RL consistently improves consultation quality across diverse medical scenarios. We also apply such rubric generation and training pipeline to InfoBench, where ORBIT enhances instruction-following performance, highlighting the generality of rubric-based feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Knowledge Intervention Prompt Tuning for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12639v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown great potential in feature transfer and generalization across a wide spectrum of medical-related downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/usr922/cilmp.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (Early Access) July 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator, Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 5 table</p></details> |

We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.</p></details> |  |

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Triage: Structured Optimization Enhances Vision-Language Model Performance on Medical Imaging Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11898v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) show promise for diverse imaging tasks but often underperform on medical benchmarks. Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce MedPT, the first large-scale, real-world corpus for Brazilian Portuguese, comprising 384,095 authentic question-answer pairs from patient-doctor interactions. The dataset underwent a meticulous multi-stage curation protocol, using a hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis to filter noise and contextually enrich thousands of ambiguous queries. We further augmented the corpus via LLM-driven annotation, classifying questions into seven semantic types to capture user intent. Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness. We publicly release MedPT to foster the development of more equitable, accurate, and culturally-aware medical technologies for the Portuguese-speaking world.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Poisoning Vulnerabilities Across Healthcare AI Architectures: A Security Threat Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11020v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare AI systems face major vulnerabilities to data poisoning that current defenses and regulations cannot adequately address. We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10067v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

| **[Concept-RuleNet: Grounded Multi-Agent Neurosymbolic Reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11751v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (oral) |

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.</p></details> |  |

We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 5 figures |

Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce a series of clinical efficacy metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in many tasks, their utilities in detecting and correcting errors in radiology reporting are limited. This paper proposes a novel dual-knowledge infusion framework that enhances LLMs' capability for radiology report proofreading through systematic integration of medical expertise. Specifically, the knowledge infusion combines medical knowledge graph distillation (MKGD) with external knowledge retrieval (EXKR), enabling an effective automated approach in tackling mistakes in radiology reporting. By decomposing the complex proofreading task into three specialized stages of detection, localization, and correction, our method mirrors the systematic review process employed by expert radiologists, ensuring both precision and clinical interpretability. To perform a robust, clinically relevant evaluation, a comprehensive benchmark is also proposed using real-world radiology reports with real-world error patterns, including speech recognition confusions, terminology ambiguities, and template-related inconsistencies. Extensive evaluations across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate substantial improvements of our approach: up to 31.56% increase in error detection accuracy and 37.4% reduction in processing time. Human evaluation by radiologists confirms superior clinical relevance and factual consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis.

Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.</p></details> | IJCNLP-AACL 2025 |

Supervised learning-based approaches have achieved significant progress but rely heavily on extensive manual annotations, limited by the availability of training data and the diversity of abnormality types. Vision-language alignment (VLA) offers a promising alternative by enabling zero-shot learning without additional annotations. However, we empirically discover that the visual and textural embeddings after alignment endeavors from existing VLA methods form two well-separated clusters, presenting a wide gap to be bridged. To bridge this gap, we propose a Bridged Semantic Alignment (BrgSA) framework. First, we utilize a large language model to perform semantic summarization of reports, extracting high-level semantic information. Second, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Interaction module that leverages a cross-modal knowledge bank as a semantic bridge, facilitating interaction between the two modalities, narrowing the gap, and improving their alignment. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark dataset that includes 15 underrepresented abnormalities as well as utilize two existing benchmark datasets.

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research remains limited in terms of dataset diversity, diagnostic performance, and clinical applicability. In this study, we propose \textbf{Auto-US}, an intelligent diagnosis agent that integrates ultrasound video data with clinical diagnostic text. To support this, we constructed \textbf{CUV Dataset} of 495 ultrasound videos spanning five categories and three organs, aggregated from multiple open-access sources. We developed \textbf{CTU-Net}, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in ultrasound video classification, reaching an accuracy of 86.73\% Furthermore, by incorporating large language models, Auto-US is capable of generating clinically meaningful diagnostic suggestions. The final diagnostic scores for each case exceeded 3 out of 5 and were validated by professional clinicians. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of Auto-US in real-world ultrasound applications.

| **[Selection of LLM Fine-Tuning Data based on Orthogonal Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04715v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality training data is critical to the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent work has explored using LLMs to rate and select data based on a small set of human-designed criteria (rules), but these approaches often rely heavily on heuristics, lack principled metrics for rule evaluation, and generalize poorly to new tasks. We propose a novel rule-based data selection framework that introduces a metric based on the orthogonality of rule score vectors to evaluate and select complementary rules. Our automated pipeline first uses LLMs to generate diverse rules covering multiple aspects of data quality, then rates samples according to these rules and applies the determinantal point process (DPP) to select the most independent rules. These rules are then used to score the full dataset, and high-scoring samples are selected for downstream tasks such as LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework in two experiment setups: (1) alignment with ground-truth ratings and (2) performance of LLMs fine-tuned on the selected data. Experiments across IMDB, Medical, Math, and Code domains demonstrate that our DPP-based rule selection consistently improves both rating accuracy and downstream model performance over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selecting Auxiliary Data via Neural Tangent Kernels for Low-Resource Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07380v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across widespread tasks, yet their application in low-resource domains remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the high risk of overfitting. While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \textbf{\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.</p></details> | 27 pages |

While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments.

Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists' capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs), particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel, vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT, a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |

The involvement of multiple organs and systems, and the shortage of specialized doctors with relevant experience, make diagnosing and treating rare diseases more challenging than common diseases. Recently, agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable applications across various domains. In the medical field, some agent methods have outperformed direct prompts in question-answering tasks from medical examinations. However, current agent frameworks are not well-adapted to real-world clinical scenarios, especially those involving the complex demands of rare diseases. To bridge this gap, we introduce RareAgents, the first LLM-driven multi-disciplinary team decision-support tool designed specifically for the complex clinical context of rare diseases. RareAgents integrates advanced Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) coordination, memory mechanisms, and medical tools utilization, leveraging Llama-3.1-8B/70B as the base model. Experimental results show that RareAgents outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models, GPT-4o, and current agent frameworks in diagnosis and treatment for rare diseases. Furthermore, we contribute a novel rare disease dataset, MIMIC-IV-Ext-Rare, to facilitate further research in this field.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Oral |
| **[When Evidence Contradicts: Toward Safer Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06668v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes information domains such as healthcare, where large language models (LLMs) can produce hallucinations or misinformation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been proposed as a mitigation strategy, grounding model outputs in external, domain-specific documents. Yet, this approach can introduce errors when source documents contain outdated or contradictory information. This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers. These results highlight that retrieval similarity alone is insufficient for reliable medical RAG and underscore the need for contradiction-aware filtering strategies to ensure trustworthy responses in high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Feature Generation for Domain-Specific Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11177v4)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature generation can significantly enhance learning outcomes, particularly for tasks with limited data. An effective way to improve feature generation is to expand the current feature space using existing features and enriching the informational content. However, generating new, interpretable features usually requires domain-specific knowledge on top of the existing features. In this paper, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Feature Generation method, RAFG, to generate useful and explainable features specific to domain classification tasks. To increase the interpretability of the generated features, we conduct knowledge retrieval among the existing features in the domain to identify potential feature associations. These associations are expected to help generate useful features. Moreover, we develop a framework based on large language models (LLMs) for feature generation with reasoning to verify the quality of the features during their generation process. Experiments across several datasets in medical, economic, and geographic domains show that our RAFG method can produce high-quality, meaningful features and significantly improve classification performance compared with baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models, have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B, EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4\% in clinical metrics across four major datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9\% on unseen datasets.</p></details> | AACL 2025 |

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, existing dermatology datasets are limited in their inclusion of concept-level meta-labels, and none offer rich medical descriptions in natural language. This deficiency impedes the advancement of LLM-based methods in dermatologic diagnosis. To address this gap and provide a meticulously annotated dermatology dataset with comprehensive natural language descriptions, we introduce \textbf{SkinCaRe}, a comprehensive multimodal resource that unifies \textit{SkinCAP} and \textit{SkinCoT}. \textbf{SkinCAP} comprises 4,000 images sourced from the Fitzpatrick 17k skin disease dataset and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, annotated by board-certified dermatologists to provide extensive medical descriptions and captions. In addition, we introduce \textbf{SkinCoT}, a curated dataset pairing 3,041 dermatologic images with clinician-verified, hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) diagnoses. Each diagnostic narrative is rigorously evaluated against six quality criteria and iteratively refined until it meets a predefined standard of clinical accuracy and explanatory depth. Together, SkinCAP (captioning) and SkinCoT (reasoning), collectively referred to as SkinCaRe, encompass 7,041 expertly curated dermatologic cases and provide a unified and trustworthy resource for training multimodal models that both describe and explain dermatologic images.

This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred interest in automating echocardiographic interpretation. However, most existing medical VLMs rely on single-frame (image) inputs, which can reduce diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable only through cardiac motion. In addition, echocardiographic videos are captured from multiple views, each varying in suitability for detecting specific conditions. Leveraging multiple views may therefore improve diagnostic performance. We developed a video-language model that processes full video sequences from five standard views, trained on 60,747 echocardiographic video-report pairs. We evaluated the gains in retrieval performance from video input and multi-view support, including the contributions of various pretrained models.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | TKDD 2025 |

However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel approach that exploits these unique patterns to break the security and alignment constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce ExGra-Med, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, ExGra-Med matches LLaVA-Med's performance using just 10% of the pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance.

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

While achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training. It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly, to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Medication Extraction and Discontinuation Identification from Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11137v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs) is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on their scalability on medication information extraction without human annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset (68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%) datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance, while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ask WhAI:Probing Belief Formation in Role-Primed LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14780v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors ("act like a neurologist", "act like an infectious disease specialist"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[CancerGUIDE: Cancer Guideline Understanding via Internal Disagreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07325v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |
| **[RxSafeBench: Identifying Medication Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Simulated Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04328v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets, constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725 contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs. A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in BIBM2025</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to LREC 2026 (under review) To access the dataset, see https://github.com/bonzid/CareMedEval</p></details> |

In clinical workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on behalf of the PREDICTOM consortium</p></details> |
| **[Toward Clinically Grounded Foundation Models in Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Chest X-ray with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07416v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs) techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective replies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

Creating rigorous ACs is particularly challenging in the context of software product lines (SPLs), i.e, sets of software products with overlapping but distinct features and behaviours. Since SPLs can encompass very large numbers of products, developing a rigorous AC for each product individually is infeasible. Moreover, if the SPL evolves, e.g., by the modification or introduction of features, it can be infeasible to assess the impact of this change. Instead, the development and maintenance of ACs ought to be lifted such that a single AC can be developed for the entire SPL simultaneously, and be analyzed for regression in a variability-aware fashion. In this article, we describe a formal approach to lifted AC development and regression analysis. We formalize a language of variability-aware ACs for SPLs and study the lifting of template-based AC development. We also define a regression analysis to determine the effects of SPL evolutions on variability-aware ACs. We describe a model-based assurance management tool which implements these techniques, and illustrate our contributions by developing an AC for a product line of medical devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |

In particular, traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized, bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models (LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage, factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01782v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promising progress in lossless image compression. However, directly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suffers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based compressors often overlook the security of the compression process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this insight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first devised to partition the entire image into two segments, providing global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we innovatively propose a segmented message steganography algorithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of compression ratios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data. Our benchmark introduces diversity across three key dimensions: scenarios, modalities, and operators. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, and text. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators. We evaluated our benchmark on three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.</p></details> |  |
| **[When to Trust the Answer: Question-Aligned Semantic Nearest Neighbor Entropy for Safer Surgical VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01458v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety and reliability are essential for deploying Visual Question Answering (VQA) in surgery, where incorrect or ambiguous responses can harm the patient. Most surgical VQA research focuses on accuracy or linguistic quality while overlooking safety behaviors such as ambiguity awareness, referral to human experts, or triggering a second opinion. Inspired by Automatic Failure Detection (AFD), we study uncertainty estimation as a key enabler of safer decision making. We introduce Question Aligned Semantic Nearest Neighbor Entropy (QA-SNNE), a black box uncertainty estimator that incorporates question semantics into prediction confidence. It measures semantic entropy by comparing generated answers with nearest neighbors in a medical text embedding space, conditioned on the question. We evaluate five models, including domain specific Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) models and zero-shot Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), on EndoVis18-VQA and PitVQA. PEFT models degrade under mild paraphrasing, while LVLMs are more resilient. Across three LVLMs and two PEFT baselines, QA-SNNE improves AUROC in most in-template settings and enhances hallucination detection. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) increases by 15-38% for zero-shot models, with gains maintained under out-of-template stress. QA-SNNE offers a practical and interpretable step toward AFD in surgical VQA by linking semantic uncertainty to question context. Combining LVLM backbones with question aligned uncertainty estimation can improve safety and clinician trust.

In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Presupposition Robustness in Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01360v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly, more and more people are turning to large language models (LLMs) for healthcare advice and consultation, making it important to gauge the efficacy and accuracy of the responses of LLMs to such queries. While there are pre-existing medical benchmarks literature which seeks to accomplish this very task, these benchmarks are almost universally in English, which has led to a notable gap in existing literature pertaining to multilingual LLM evaluation. Within this work, we seek to aid in addressing this gap with Cancer-Myth-Indic, an Indic language benchmark built by translating a 500-item subset of Cancer-Myth, sampled evenly across its original categories, into five under-served but widely used languages from the subcontinent (500 per language; 2,500 translated items total). Native-speaker translators followed a style guide for preserving implicit presuppositions in translation; items feature false presuppositions relating to cancer.

In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://web.stanford.edu/~markendo/projects/downscaling_intelligence</p></details> |

Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Reward Optimization for Machine Translation using Error Severity Mappings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05986v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be an effective and robust method for training neural machine translation systems, especially when paired with powerful reward models that accurately assess translation quality. However, most research has focused on RL methods that use sentence-level feedback, leading to inefficient learning signals due to the reward sparsity problem -- the model receives a single score for the entire sentence. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages fine-grained, token-level quality assessments along with error severity levels using RL methods. Specifically, we use xCOMET, a state-of-the-art quality estimation system, as our token-level reward model. We conduct experiments on small and large translation datasets with standard encoder-decoder and large language models-based machine translation systems, comparing the impact of sentence-level versus fine-grained reward signals on translation quality. Our results show that training with token-level rewards improves translation quality across language pairs over baselines according to both automatic and human evaluation. Furthermore, token-level reward optimization improves training stability, evidenced by a steady increase in mean rewards over training epochs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked-and-Reordered Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17473v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonaAgent with GraphRAG: Community-Aware Knowledge Graphs for Personalized LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17467v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PersonaAgentwGraphRAG-DE6F</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The degree to which large language models (LLMs) produce writing that is truly human-like remains unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-o4 mini, and ChatGPT-4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n = 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness, disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAs, and Support Vector Machines revealed that the ChatGPT-generated texts differed significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini and ChatGPT-4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated higher levels of lexical diversity than older models despite producing fewer tokens. The human writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education, language status). Altogether, the results indicate that ChatGPT models do not produce human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer models produce less human-like text than older models. We discuss the implications of these results for language pedagogy and related applications.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

However, repository-level code generation presents unique challenges, particularly due to the need to utilize information spread across multiple files within a repository. Specifically, successful generation depends on a solid grasp of both general, context-agnostic knowledge and specific, context-dependent knowledge. While LLMs are widely used for the context-agnostic aspect, existing retrieval-based approaches sometimes fall short as they are limited in obtaining a broader and deeper repository context. In this paper, we present CatCoder, a novel code generation framework designed for statically typed programming languages. CatCoder enhances repository-level code generation by integrating relevant code and type context. Specifically, it leverages static analyzers to extract type dependencies and merges this information with retrieved code to create comprehensive prompts for LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder, we adapt and construct benchmarks that include 199 Java tasks and 90 Rust tasks. The results show that CatCoder outperforms the RepoCoder baseline by up to 14.44% and 17.35%, in terms of compile@k and pass@k scores. In addition, the generalizability of CatCoder is assessed using various LLMs, including both code-specialized models and general-purpose models. Our findings indicate consistent performance improvements across all models, which underlines the practicality of CatCoder. Furthermore, we evaluate the time consumption of CatCoder in a large open source repository, and the results demonstrate the scalability of CatCoder.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and extended version; To be published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

To address the challenge, we present RoboCOIN, a comprehensive multi-embodiment bimanual manipulation dataset with over 180,000 demonstrations collected from 15 distinct robotic platforms. The dataset covers 16 scenarios, including residential, commercial, and working environments, with 421 tasks systematically organized by bimanual coordination patterns and object properties. Our key innovation is a hierarchical capability pyramid that provides multi-level annotations, spanning trajectory-level concepts, segment-level subtasks, and frame-level kinematics. We further develop CoRobot, a comprehensive processing framework featuring Robot Trajectory Markup Language (RTML) for quality assessment, automated annotation generation, and unified multi-embodiment management. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of RoboCOIN in multi-embodiment bimanual learning, with significant performance improvements across various model architectures and robotic platforms. The complete dataset and framework are open-sourced and publicly available for further research purposes. Project website: https://FlagOpen.github.io/RoboCOIN/.</p></details> |  |

While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 tables, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that LIVE-SWE-AGENT can achieve an impressive solve rate of 77.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing software agents, including the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, EurIPS 2025 Workshop on Private AI Governance</p></details> |
| **[Seeing the Forest and the Trees: Query-Aware Tokenizer for Long-Video Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11910v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage. Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence.</p></details> |  |

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.</p></details> |  |

In the world of Scientific Software (SSW), where innovation moves fast and collaboration is key, such debt is not just common but deeply impactful. As research relies on accurate and reproducible results, accumulating SATD can threaten the very foundations of scientific discovery. Yet, despite its significance, the relationship between SATD and SSW remains largely unexplored, leaving a crucial gap in understanding how to manage SATD in this critical domain. This study explores SATD in SSW repositories, comparing SATD in scientific versus general-purpose open-source software and evaluating transformer-based models for SATD identification. We analyzed SATD in 27 scientific and general-purpose repositories across multiple domains and languages. We fine-tuned and compared 10 transformer-based models (100M-7B parameters) on 67,066 labeled code comments. SSW contains 9.25x more Scientific Debt and 4.93x more SATD than general-purpose software due to complex computations, domain constraints, and evolving research needs. Furthermore, our best model outperforms existing ones. This study uncovers how SATD in SSW differs from general software, revealing its impact on quality and scientific validity. By recognizing these challenges, developers and researchers can adopt smarter strategies to manage debt and safeguard the integrity of scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Toxicity to Conformity: Adaptive user behavior to social norms in Telegram communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17333v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxic and antisocial user behavior on social media platforms has received considerable scholarly attention due to its detrimental effects on society. This study takes a holistic perspective on the phenomenon of online toxicity by investigating the impact of local community norms on toxic expression. By using six large-scale datasets, comprising over 500 million Telegram messages collected between 2015 and 2024, we analyze toxic user behavior across multiple chats and languages. We introduce a methodological framework that models user adaptation through a conformity index, capturing conformist, anti-conformist, and independent behavioral tendencies. Our findings show that most users tend to conform to local normative environments, adjusting their toxicity to match the toxicity levels of the chats in which they participate. These patterns are consistent across datasets and languages, suggesting that community norms and social influence play a decisive role in shaping user behavior online. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to these norms, in terms of increased user participation in chats, is associated with a stronger tendency toward conformity with the surrounding social contexts. Collectively, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of toxic online behavior and highlight the importance of contextualized approaches to content moderation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17330v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generated code is gaining traction recently, owing to the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Further, the AlphaProof initiative has demonstrated the possibility of using AI for general mathematical reasoning. Reasoning about computer programs (software) can be accomplished via general mathematical reasoning; however, it tends to be more structured and richer in contexts. This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI. In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree. Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics. We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04224v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We find no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrate nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive and Robust Data Poisoning Detection and Sanitization in Wearable IoT Systems using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02894v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting, whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives. These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable IoT systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialGeo:Boosting Spatial Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Geometry-Semantics Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17308v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of The Southern African Conference on AI Research (SACAIR 2024), Bloemfontein, South Africa, 2-6 December 2024.

However, existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 -- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight paper.

This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.</p></details> |  |

We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.</p></details> | Preprint |

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance up to 86.7% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but require additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p></details> |  |

OpenDriveVLA generates spatially grounded driving actions by leveraging multimodal inputs, including 2D and 3D instance-aware visual representations, ego vehicle states, and language commands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and language embeddings, we introduce a hierarchical vision language alignment process, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified semantic space. Furthermore, we incorporate structured agent environment ego interaction modeling into the autoregressive decoding process, enabling the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and behavior-aware dynamics critical for reliable trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OpenDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across open-loop trajectory planning and driving-related question answering tasks. Qualitative analyses further illustrate its capability to follow high-level driving commands and generate trajectories under challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for next-generation end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOCHA: Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14001v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized object detection aims to adapt a general-purpose detector to recognize user-specific instances from only a few examples. Lightweight models often struggle in this setting due to their weak semantic priors, while large vision-language models (VLMs) offer strong object-level understanding but are too computationally demanding for real-time or on-device applications. We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a distillation framework that transfers multimodal region-level knowledge from a frozen VLM teacher into a lightweight vision-only detector. MOCHA extracts fused visual and textual teacher's embeddings and uses them to guide student training through a dual-objective loss that enforces accurate local alignment and global relational consistency across regions. This process enables efficient transfer of semantics without the need for teacher modifications or textual input at inference. MOCHA consistently outperforms prior baselines across four personalized detection benchmarks under strict few-shot regimes, yielding a +10.1 average improvement, with minimal inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Representations for Poverty Mapping: Unified Vision-Language Codes or Agent-Induced Novelty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01109v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures |

However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

This study evaluates the performance of several large language models (LLMs) in restoring diacritics in Romanian texts.

It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics. This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries. Built on ChatGPT-4o, one of the most representative LLMs, SlsReuse achieves Recall@10 of 91.20%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline by 24.53 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making.

While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases.

However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV'26 |

In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Project Page: https://github.com/SooLab/AllPath</p></details> |

Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term software maintenance and collaboration, yet current automated approaches still fail to model the rich semantic dependencies and architectural structures that define real-world software systems. We present \textbf{CodeWiki}, a unified framework for automated repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki introduces three key innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context across multiple levels of granularity, (ii) recursive multi-agent processing with dynamic task delegation for scalable generation, and (iii) multi-modal synthesis that integrates textual descriptions with visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data-flow representations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce \textbf{CodeWikiBench}, a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-dimensional rubrics and LLM-based assessment protocols. Experimental results show that CodeWiki achieves a 68.79\% quality score with proprietary models, outperforming the closed-source DeepWiki baseline (64.06\%) by 4.73\%, with particularly strong improvements on high-level scripting languages (+10.47\%).

Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Self-Supervised and Cross-Modal Pretraining for Volumetric CT Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17209v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SPECTRE, a fully transformer-based foundation model for volumetric computed tomography (CT). Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Sparse frame sampling thus becomes a necessary preprocessing step, with sampled frame quality directly impacting downstream performance. Existing keyframe search algorithms achieve a balance between efficiency and sampled frame quality but heavily rely on the visual modality alone. This makes them difficult to adapt to text-related tasks and often leads to retrieval results deviating from core semantic content. To address this, we propose the VISUAL-SUBTITLE INTEGRATION (VSI), a multimodal keyframe retrieval framework. It employs a dual-branch collaborative retrieval approach combining Video Search and Subtitle Match to fuse complementary visual and textual information for precise localization. Experiments on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrate that VSI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in keyframe retrieval while delivering breakthrough performance in text-related tasks and exhibiting strong generalization across other tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages,3 figures |

However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).</p></details> |  |

We show that intermediate activations in decoder-only LLMs form a vulnerable attack surface for behavioral control. Building on recent findings on attention sinks and compression valleys, we identify a high-gain region in the residual stream where small, well-aligned perturbations are causally amplified along the autoregressive trajectory--a Causal Amplification Effect (CAE). We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Generalization of Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problems via Test-Time Projection Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02392v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising learning-based paradigm for addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by minimizing the need for extensive manual engineering. While existing NCO methods, trained on small-scale instances (e.g., 100 nodes), have demonstrated considerable success on problems of similar scale, their performance significantly degrades when applied to large-scale scenarios. This degradation arises from the distributional shift between training and testing data, rendering policies learned on small instances ineffective for larger problems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel learning framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework learns a projection between the training and testing distributions, which is then deployed to enhance the scalability of the NCO model. Notably, unlike prevailing techniques that necessitate joint training with the neural network, our approach operates exclusively during the inference phase, obviating the need for model retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables a backbone model (trained on 100-node instances) to achieve superior performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) of up to 100K nodes from diverse distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.24627</p></details> |
| **[AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Robot Design with Multi-Objective Black-Box Optimization and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17178v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various methods for robot design optimization have been developed so far. These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, ACL 2025</p></details> |

Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data curation, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, i.e., single input, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich, multifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM capabilities. In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF) for multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of MLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response under explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one input, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote full parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an explicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain semantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic coverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable embedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass, incurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple MLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains are consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g., boosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the VLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B). In terms of efficiency, our 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6% using only half the computational budget.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |

The method trains an LLM to emulate observed decisions, then evaluates counterfactual pairs in which only gender is flipped, estimating directional disparities while holding all other clinical factors constant. We study emergency triage, validating the approach on more than 150,000 admissions to the Bordeaux University Hospital (France) and replicating results on a subset of MIMIC-IV across a different language, population, and healthcare system. In the Bordeaux cohort, otherwise identical presentations were approximately 2.1% more likely to receive a lower-severity triage score when presented as female rather than male; scaled to national emergency volumes in France, this corresponds to more than 200,000 lower-severity assignments per year. Modality-specific analyses indicate that both explicit tabular gender indicators and implicit textual gender cues contribute to the disparity. Beyond emergency care, the approach supports bias audits in other settings (e.g., hiring, academic, and justice decisions), providing a scalable tool to detect and address inequities in real-world decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |
| **[How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, previous KD methods are primarily applied to white-box classification models or training small models to imitate black-box model APIs like ChatGPT. How to effectively distill the knowledge of white-box LLMs into small models is still under-explored, which becomes more important with the prosperity of open-source LLMs. In this work, we propose a KD approach that distills LLMs into smaller language models. We first replace the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD on generative language models, to prevent the student model from overestimating the low-probability regions of the teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective on-policy optimization approach to learn this objective. The student models are named MiniLLM. Extensive experiments in the instruction-following setting show that MiniLLM generates more precise responses with higher overall quality, lower exposure bias, better calibration, and higher long-text generation performance than the baselines. Our method is scalable for different model families with 120M to 13B parameters. Our code, data, and model checkpoints can be found in https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To train AutoV, we develop an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various visual prompts for LVLMs. Experiments indicate that AutoV enhances the performance of various LVLMs across multiple image understanding tasks. For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{10.2}\%$ accuracy gain on VizWiz, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{3.8}\%$ on MMMU, highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Why Do Language Model Agents Whistleblow?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17085v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUCH: A Multilingual Claim Hallucination Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17081v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Annotation-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models. Our code is published at https://github.com/Wings-Of-Disaster/VaLiK.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables; Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 2 algorithms, 2 tables, 4 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Emergence of psychopathological computations in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08016v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models (LLMs) instantiate computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, psychopathological computations, derived from the adapted theory, need to be empirically identified within the LLM's internal processing. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. Based on the framework, we conduct experiments demonstrating two key claims: first, that the computational structure of psychopathology exists in LLMs; and second, that executing this computational structure results in psychopathological functions. We further observe that as LLM size increases, the computational structure of psychopathology becomes denser and that the functions become more effective. Taken together, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Our work shows the promise of developing a new powerful in silico model of psychopathology and also alludes to the possibility of safety threat from the AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.</p></details> | pre-print |
| **[OmniPT: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Language Models for Pedestrian Tracking and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17053v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[PathAgent: Toward Interpretable Analysis of Whole-slide Pathology Images via Large Language Model-based Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17052v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Latent Routing of LoRA Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17044v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PRAG) is a novel RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into a Large Language Model (LLM) by parameterizing documents using LoRA adapters, demonstrating reduced inference costs compared to traditional RAG approaches. However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of Poly-PRAG across multiple knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results on four distinct datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVul-CoT: Towards Effective Software Vulnerability Assessment with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17027v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Software Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) plays a vital role in evaluating and ranking vulnerabilities in software systems to ensure their security and reliability. Objective: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable potential in SVA, they still face two major limitations. First, most LLMs are trained on general-purpose corpora and thus lack domain-specific knowledge essential for effective SVA. Second, they tend to rely on shallow pattern matching instead of deep contextual reasoning, making it challenging to fully comprehend complex code semantics and their security implications. Method: To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel framework ReVul-CoT that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting. In ReVul-CoT, the RAG module dynamically retrieves contextually relevant information from a constructed local knowledge base that consolidates vulnerability data from authoritative sources (such as NVD and CWE), along with corresponding code snippets and descriptive information. Building on DeepSeek-V3.1, CoT prompting guides the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning over exploitability, impact scope, and related factors Results: We evaluate ReVul-CoT on a dataset of 12,070 vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that ReVul-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines by 16.50%-42.26% in terms of MCC, and outperforms the best baseline by 10.43%, 15.86%, and 16.50% in Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC, respectively. Our ablation studies further validate the contributions of considering dynamic retrieval, knowledge integration, and CoT-based reasoning. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that combining RAG with CoT prompting significantly enhances LLM-based SVA and points out promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00794v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</p></details> |  |

SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.7}\,$\times$ faster than veRL in end-to-end training, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to baselines with speculative decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine Tuning of Large Language Models for Domain Specific Knowledge Graph Construction:A Case Study on Hunan's Historical Celebrities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17012v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-Aware Tool-Use Enables Effective Agent Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17006v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Language Models are Confused Tourists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17004v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, we introduce ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation, enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/bwookwak/ToolHaystack Edited for adding acknowledgement section</p></details> |

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Draft and Refine with Visual Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11005v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems. Code is available at https://github.com/EavnJeong/Draft-and-Refine-with-Visual-Experts.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii) By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes, often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rise of Parameter Specialization for Knowledge Storage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17260v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities, their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. While existing jailbreak attacks largely rely on single-turn or multi-turn prompt manipulations, or inject static in-context examples, these methods suffer from limited effectiveness, inefficiency, or semantic drift. We introduce Response Attack (RA), a novel framework that strategically leverages intermediate, mildly harmful responses as contextual primers within a dialogue. By reformulating harmful queries and injecting these intermediate responses before issuing a targeted trigger prompt, RA exploits a previously overlooked vulnerability in LLMs. Extensive experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show that RA consistently achieves significantly higher attack success rates than nine leading jailbreak baselines. Our results demonstrate that the success of RA is directly attributable to the strategic use of intermediate responses, which induce models to generate more explicit and relevant harmful content while maintaining stealth, efficiency, and fidelity to the original query.

These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiPriv: Benchmarking Individual-Level Privacy Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16940v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article-headline pairs spanning almost a decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Developed as an Arabic counterpart to major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail, AraFinNews offers a strong benchmark for assessing domain-focused language understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we evaluate transformer-based models, including mT5, AraT5 and the domain-adapted FinAraT5, to investigate how financial-domain pretraining influences accuracy, numerical reliability and stylistic alignment with professional reporting. The results show that domain-adapted models produce more coherent summaries, particularly when handling quantitative and entity-centred information. These findings underscore the value of domain-specific adaptation for improving narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation.

Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[OmniScientist: Toward a Co-evolving Ecosystem of Human and AI Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16931v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-REAL: Towards Realism and Plausibility Evaluation for AI-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16908v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training? To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPRO: Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization for Enhancing Medical QA and Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00974v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO distinguishes itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns model outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley--Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA, MedQA-USMLE, and a real-world clinical dataset from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 2B-parameter model outperforms much larger 7B--20B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement provides a scalable and clinically grounded approach to building more reliable medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond. With complete ground truth information, FunnyNodules provides a versatile foundation for developing, benchmarking, and conducting in-depth analyses of explainable AI methods in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Generative AI: World Models for Clinical Prediction, Counterfactuals, and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16333v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p></details> | 2 Figures, 1 Table |
| **[Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning via Geometric Projection Reference Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16139v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including 2 pages of references), 4 figures.

This paper introduces a theoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions between buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with theoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives high-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term model performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in data valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives by sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and sellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal outcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining market participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP tasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning, fairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality data, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our findings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically sustainable data markets for LLM.</p></details> |  |

To support skin specific reasoning, we build DermCoT, a corpus of standardized dermatologic chain of thought narratives that combines 10,000 DermEval filtered training cases with 3,000 dermatologist scored certified cases, and we define DermEval as a physician aligned six dimensional evaluator and DermBench as the corresponding benchmark for dermatologic chain of thought quality. On DermBench, across 14 general, reasoning, and medical vision language models, SkinGPT-R1 achieves an average score of 4.031 out of 5 over the six clinician defined dimensions, ranks 1st among all systems, and improves the average score over Vision-R1 by about 41%. On three dermatology classification benchmarks, SkinGPT-R1 delivers stable accuracy gains over Vision-R1 and remains competitive among strong vision language models. Ablation results further show that DermCoT based chain of thought supervision provides substantial improvements over the base model and that adding dermatology aware visual distillation yields consistent additional gains in both narrative quality and recognition.</p></details> |  |

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability.

Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI-26 (ORAL)</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms baseline methods, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mihara-bot/DIQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Specialized Large Language Model for Clinical Reasoning and Diagnosis in Rare Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14638v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce MedGEN-Bench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026 Under Review</p></details> |

However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present DIVER, a retrieval pipeline designed for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. It consists of four components. The document preprocessing stage enhances readability and preserves content by cleaning noisy texts and segmenting long documents. The query expansion stage leverages large language models to iteratively refine user queries with explicit reasoning and evidence from retrieved documents. The retrieval stage employs a model fine-tuned on synthetic data spanning medical and mathematical domains, along with hard negatives, enabling effective handling of reasoning-intensive queries. Finally, the reranking stage combines pointwise and listwise strategies to produce both fine-grained and globally consistent rankings. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 46.8 overall and 31.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CafeMed: Causal Attention Fusion Enhanced Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14064v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[PASS: Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling for Interpretable and Adaptive Chest X-Ray Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10501v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[S4M: 4-points to Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05534v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) promises to ease the annotation bottleneck in medical segmentation, but overlapping anatomy and blurred boundaries make its point prompts ambiguous, leading to cycles of manual refinement to achieve precise masks. Better prompting strategies are needed. Methods: We propose a structured prompting strategy using 4 points as a compact instance-level shape description. We study two 4-point variants: extreme points and the proposed major/minor axis endpoints, inspired by ultrasound measurement practice. SAM cannot fully exploit such structured prompts because it treats all points identically and lacks geometry-aware reasoning. To address this, we introduce S4M (4-points to Segment Anything), which augments SAM to interpret 4 points as relational cues rather than isolated clicks. S4M expands the prompt space with role-specific embeddings and adds an auxiliary "Canvas" pretext task that sketches coarse masks directly from prompts, fostering geometry-aware reasoning. Results: Across eight datasets in ultrasound and surgical endoscopy, S4M improves segmentation by +3.42 mIoU over a strong SAM baseline at equal prompt budget. An annotation study with three clinicians further shows that major/minor prompts enable faster annotation. Conclusion: S4M increases performance, reduces annotation effort, and aligns prompting with clinical practice, enabling more scalable dataset development in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

| **[Can Large Language Models Function as Qualified Pediatricians? A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13381v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.</p></details> |  |

Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MedFact, a challenging Chinese medical fact-checking benchmark with 2,116 expert-annotated instances from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 specialties, 8 error types, 4 writing styles, and 5 difficulty levels. Construction uses a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert feedback refines AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering to ensure high quality and difficulty. We evaluate 20 leading LLMs on veracity classification and error localization, and results show models often determine if text contains errors but struggle to localize them precisely, with top performers falling short of human performance. Our analysis reveals the "over-criticism" phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify correct information as erroneous, which can be exacerbated by advanced reasoning techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. MedFact highlights the challenges of deploying medical LLMs and provides resources to develop factually reliable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026-AIA and designated as an oral presentation paper</p></details> |

We introduce R$^{2}$Seg, a training-free framework for robust OOD tumor segmentation that operates via a two-stage Reason-and-Reject process. First, the Reason step employs an LLM-guided anatomical reasoning planner to localize organ anchors and generate multi-scale ROIs. Second, the Reject step applies two-sample statistical testing to candidates generated by a frozen foundation model (BiomedParse) within these ROIs. This statistical rejection filter retains only candidates significantly different from normal tissue, effectively suppressing false positives. Our framework requires no parameter updates, making it compatible with zero-update test-time augmentation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. On multi-center and multi-modal tumor segmentation benchmarks, R$^{2}$Seg substantially improves Dice, specificity, and sensitivity over strong baselines and the original foundation models.

Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results, their high computational cost hinders clinical deployment. To address this issue, we propose TM-UNet, a novel lightweight framework that integrates token sequence modeling with an efficient memory mechanism for efficient medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale token-memory (MSTM) block that transforms 2D spatial features into token sequences through strategic spatial scanning, leveraging matrix memory cells to selectively retain and propagate discriminative contextual information across tokens. This novel token-memory mechanism acts as a dynamic knowledge store that captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient global reasoning without redundant computation. Our MSTM block further incorporates exponential gating to identify token effectiveness and multi-scale contextual extraction via parallel pooling operations, enabling hierarchical representation learning without computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical segmentation tasks with substantially reduced computation cost.

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 12pages, 6 figures |

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p></details> |  |

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.</p></details> | 2 figures 7 pages |

Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (oral) |
| **[Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment from LDCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06625v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRNet: Integrating Constrained Graph-Based Reasoning with Pre-training for Diagnostic Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10013v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | To appear at AAAI-26 |

However, high-performing neural networks typically cannot explain their predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods provide a way to understand neural networks but have been shown to suffer from conceptual problems. Moreover, current research largely focuses on providing local explanations for individual samples rather than global explanations for the model itself. In this paper, we propose Attri-Net, an inherently interpretable model for multi-label classification that provides local and global explanations. Attri-Net first counterfactually generates class-specific attribution maps to highlight the disease evidence, then performs classification with logistic regression classifiers based solely on the attribution maps. Local explanations for each prediction can be obtained by interpreting the attribution maps weighted by the classifiers' weights. Global explanation of whole model can be obtained by jointly considering learned average representations of the attribution maps for each class (called the class centers) and the weights of the linear classifiers. To ensure the model is ``right for the right reason", we further introduce a mechanism to guide the model's explanations to align with human knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations show that Attri-Net can generate high-quality explanations consistent with clinical knowledge while not sacrificing classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:028</p></details> |

However, computational costs and privacy concerns are mounting barriers to wide-scale implementation. To address these significant limitations, we introduce a parsimonious adaptation of phi-3-mini, MedMobile, a 3.8 billion parameter LM capable of running on a mobile device, for medical applications. We perform a careful set of pipeline additions and demonstrate that chain of thought, ensembling, and fine-tuning lead to the greatest performance gains, while unexpectedly retrieval augmented generation fails to demonstrate significant improvements. We evaluate the efficiency of our pipeline on the MultiMedQA and MedBullets. We demonstrate that MedMobile scores 75.7% on the MedQA (USMLE), surpassing the passing mark for licensed physicians (~60%) and rivaling scores of models 100 times its size. Across the entirety of the MultiMedQA, MedMobile achieves SOTA performance for models with less than 5B parameters and represents the smallest model to pass the MedQA (USMLE). MedMobile holds promise to democratize access to language models in medicine, bolstering lower compute needs and fast inference speeds. With the ability to combat the biggest barriers to entry for language models in medicine, we hope that MedMobile is a critical step forward in developing clinically relevant language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures (4 main, 3 supplementary)</p></details> |

We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 5 figures |

On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance, except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C, GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the low reasoning setting.

Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.</p></details> | IJCNLP-AACL 2025 |

Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\times$ faster than FedAVG).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 Main track.

To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Med-SORA: Symptom to Organ Reasoning in Abdomen CT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06752v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning. However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images. Med-SORA introduces RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global image features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning. Experimental results show that Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Feature Generation for Domain-Specific Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11177v4)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature generation can significantly enhance learning outcomes, particularly for tasks with limited data. An effective way to improve feature generation is to expand the current feature space using existing features and enriching the informational content. However, generating new, interpretable features usually requires domain-specific knowledge on top of the existing features. In this paper, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Feature Generation method, RAFG, to generate useful and explainable features specific to domain classification tasks. To increase the interpretability of the generated features, we conduct knowledge retrieval among the existing features in the domain to identify potential feature associations. These associations are expected to help generate useful features. Moreover, we develop a framework based on large language models (LLMs) for feature generation with reasoning to verify the quality of the features during their generation process. Experiments across several datasets in medical, economic, and geographic domains show that our RAFG method can produce high-quality, meaningful features and significantly improve classification performance compared with baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models, have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B, EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4\% in clinical metrics across four major datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9\% on unseen datasets.</p></details> | AACL 2025 |
| **[MedVoiceBias: A Controlled Study of Audio LLM Behavior in Clinical Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06592v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.</p></details> |  |

This creates challenges for accurately calculating confidence intervals (CIs) using the normal distribution approximation. In this paper, we employ a quadratic-form based statistic, from which we derive more accurate confidence intervals, particularly for data with small sample sizes or proportions. Based on the study, we suggest reasonable values of sample sizes and proportions for the application of the quadratic method. Consequently, this method enhances the reliability of statistical inferences. We illustrate this method with real medical data from clinical trials.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $τ_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($τ_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($τ_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML4H 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |

However, existing dermatology datasets are limited in their inclusion of concept-level meta-labels, and none offer rich medical descriptions in natural language. This deficiency impedes the advancement of LLM-based methods in dermatologic diagnosis. To address this gap and provide a meticulously annotated dermatology dataset with comprehensive natural language descriptions, we introduce \textbf{SkinCaRe}, a comprehensive multimodal resource that unifies \textit{SkinCAP} and \textit{SkinCoT}. \textbf{SkinCAP} comprises 4,000 images sourced from the Fitzpatrick 17k skin disease dataset and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, annotated by board-certified dermatologists to provide extensive medical descriptions and captions. In addition, we introduce \textbf{SkinCoT}, a curated dataset pairing 3,041 dermatologic images with clinician-verified, hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) diagnoses. Each diagnostic narrative is rigorously evaluated against six quality criteria and iteratively refined until it meets a predefined standard of clinical accuracy and explanatory depth. Together, SkinCAP (captioning) and SkinCoT (reasoning), collectively referred to as SkinCaRe, encompass 7,041 expertly curated dermatologic cases and provide a unified and trustworthy resource for training multimodal models that both describe and explain dermatologic images. SkinCaRe is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuhos16/SkinCaRe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Improves Traversal of Hierarchical Knowledge in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05933v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.</p></details> | ` |
| **[CoT-X: An Adaptive Framework for Cross-Model Chain-of-Thought Transfer and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05747v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | TKDD 2025 |
| **[XBreaking: Understanding how LLMs security alignment can be broken](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21700v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel approach that exploits these unique patterns to break the security and alignment constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on their scalability on medication information extraction without human annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset (68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%) datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance, while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.</p></details> |  |

The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors ("act like a neurologist", "act like an infectious disease specialist"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces BanglaMedQA and BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional, Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies. Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy 89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in multilingual medical artificial intelligence.</p></details> | Under Review |

| **[Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks for Automated 3D Segmentation of Kidneys and Kidney Tumours in Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04334v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed, usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages, voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native 3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23 challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to LREC 2026 (under review) To access the dataset, see https://github.com/bonzid/CareMedEval</p></details> |

In clinical workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on behalf of the PREDICTOM consortium</p></details> |

However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters.

| **[Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models struggle to achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation. Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers, simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Stakeholder Conflicts and Explanatory Policies in LLM-based Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03152v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

In particular, traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized, bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data. Our benchmark introduces diversity across three key dimensions: scenarios, modalities, and operators. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, and text. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators. We evaluated our benchmark on three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

The game allows experts with different knowledge bases to collaboratively make recommendations while generating rich traces of the reasoning process through combining explanation-based illocutionary forces in an inquiry dialogue. The dialogue game was implemented as a prototype web-application and evaluated against the specification through a formative user study. The user study confirms that the dialogue game meets the needs for collaboration among medical experts. It also provides insights on the real-life value of dialogue-based communication tools for the medical community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Concept Learning with Class-Level Priors for Interpretable Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01131v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-interpretable predictions are essential for deploying AI in medical imaging, yet most interpretable-by-design (IBD) frameworks require concept annotations for training data, which are costly and impractical to obtain in clinical contexts. Recent attempts to bypass annotation, such as zero-shot vision-language models or concept-generation frameworks, struggle to capture domain-specific medical features, leading to poor reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel Prior-guided Concept Predictor (PCP), a weakly supervised framework that enables concept answer prediction without explicit supervision or reliance on language models. PCP leverages class-level concept priors as weak supervision and incorporates a refinement mechanism with KL divergence and entropy regularization to align predictions with clinical reasoning. Experiments on PH2 (dermoscopy) and WBCatt (hematology) show that PCP improves concept-level F1-score by over 33% compared to zero-shot baselines, while delivering competitive classification performance on four medical datasets (PH2, WBCatt, HAM10000, and CXR4) relative to fully supervised concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and V-IP.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fleming-VL: Towards Universal Medical Visual Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00916v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Hallucinations in Foundation Models and Their Impact on Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05777v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in foundation models arise from autoregressive training objectives that prioritize token-likelihood optimization over epistemic accuracy, fostering overconfidence and poorly calibrated uncertainty. We define medical hallucination as any model-generated output that is factually incorrect, logically inconsistent, or unsupported by authoritative clinical evidence in ways that could alter clinical decisions. We evaluated 11 foundation models (7 general-purpose, 4 medical-specialized) across seven medical hallucination tasks spanning medical reasoning and biomedical information retrieval. General-purpose models achieved significantly higher proportions of hallucination-free responses than medical-specialized models (median: 76.6% vs 51.3%, difference = 25.2%, 95% CI: 18.7-31.3%, Mann-Whitney U = 27.0, p = 0.012, rank-biserial r = -0.64). Top-performing models such as Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 97% accuracy when augmented with chain-of-thought prompting (base: 87.6%), while medical-specialized models like MedGemma ranged from 28.6-61.9% despite explicit training on medical corpora. Chain-of-thought reasoning significantly reduced hallucinations in 86.4% of tested comparisons after FDR correction (q < 0.05), demonstrating that explicit reasoning traces enable self-verification and error detection. Physician audits confirmed that 64-72% of residual hallucinations stemmed from causal or temporal reasoning failures rather than knowledge gaps. A global survey of clinicians (n = 70) validated real-world impact: 91.8% had encountered medical hallucinations, and 84.7% considered them capable of causing patient harm. The underperformance of medical-specialized models despite domain training indicates that safety emerges from sophisticated reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge integration developed during large-scale pre-training, not from narrow optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, current brain-oriented visual question-answering (VQA) benchmarks either cover a few imaging modalities or are limited to coarse-grained pathological descriptions, hindering a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs throughout the full clinical continuum. To address these, we introduce OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal VQA benchmark specifically designed to assess the multimodal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs in brain imaging analysis.OmniBrainBench consists of 15 distinct brain imaging modalities collected from 30 verified medical sources, yielding 9,527 validated VQA pairs and 31,706 images. It simulates clinical workflows and encompasses 15 multi-stage clinical tasks rigorously validated by a professional radiologist. Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source, medical, and proprietary MLLMs, highlights the substantial challenges posed by OmniBrainBench. Our experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) beat open-source and medical models but lag physicians; (2) medical MLLMs vary widely in performance; (3) open-source MLLMs trail overall but excel in specific tasks; (4) MLLMs underperform sharply in complex preoperative tasks, revealing a visual-to-clinical reasoning gap. OmniBrainBench sets a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in brain imaging analysis, highlighting gaps compared to expert clinical reasoning. We release it at benchmark \& code.</p></details> |  |

To address this barrier, we introduce CELEC, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework for automated EHR data extraction and analytics. CELEC translates natural language queries into SQL using a prompting strategy that integrates schema information, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought reasoning, which together improve accuracy and robustness. On a subset of the EHRSQL benchmark, CELEC achieves execution accuracy comparable to prior systems while maintaining low latency, cost efficiency, and strict privacy by exposing only database metadata to the LLM. CELEC also adheres to strict privacy protocols: the LLM accesses only database metadata (e.g., table and column names), while all query execution occurs securely within the institutional environment, ensuring that no patient-level data is ever transmitted to or shared with the LLM. Ablation studies confirm that each component of the SQL generation pipeline, particularly the few-shot demonstrations, plays a critical role in performance. By lowering technical barriers and enabling medical researchers to query EHR databases directly, CELEC streamlines research workflows and accelerates biomedical discovery.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through temperament-based Patient Agent and evaluates diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality via Assessor Agent. It includes 2996 cases across 34 diagnoses from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for widely used open and closed-source LVLMs. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional neural network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</p></details> | 29 pages |

We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[PETAR: Localized Findings Generation with Mask-Aware Vision-Language Modeling for PET Automated Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27680v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual BERT language model for medical tasks: Evaluation on domain-specific adaptation and cross-linguality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27552v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap, the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability. Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP. Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world computational scenarios. We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based (e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar, Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more challenging evaluation setting. To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness. Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and contextual understanding. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/maokangkun/MedCalc-Eval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CATCH: A Modular Cross-domain Adaptive Template with Hook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26582v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However, their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalGuard: A Smart System for Detecting and Preventing False Information in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11600v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they have a critical weakness: they confidently state false information that sounds entirely plausible. This "hallucination" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place. We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning. Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\% of the time while missing only 8.3\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Questionnaire meets LLM: A Benchmark and Empirical Study of Structural Skills for Understanding Questions and Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26238v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup, respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration. Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.</p></details> | NV-Reason-CXR-3B |

We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page, code, data, and models: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLSynther/</p></details> |

This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Medical Records to Diagnostic Dialogues: A Clinical-Grounded Approach and Dataset for Psychiatric Comorbidity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25232v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR) construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502 synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards. Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Role Cognition in Medical LLMs via Neuronal Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24677v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems, particularly in the context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP), instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the related code in the following repository:https: //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We evaluate AMIE, a medically fine-tuned conversational system based on Gemini with integrated web search and self-critique reasoning, using real-world clinical vignettes that reflect scenarios a general ophthalmologist would be expected to manage. We conducted two complementary evaluations: (1) a human-AI interactive diagnostic reasoning study in which ophthalmologists recorded initial differentials and plans, then reviewed AMIE's structured output and revised their answers; and (2) a masked preference and quality study comparing AMIE's narrative outputs with case author reference answers using a predefined rubric. AMIE showed standalone diagnostic performance comparable to clinicians at baseline. Crucially, after reviewing AMIE's responses, ophthalmologists tended to rank the correct diagnosis higher, reached greater agreement with one another, and enriched their investigation and management plans. Improvements were observed even when AMIE's top choice differed from or underperformed the clinician baseline, consistent with a complementary effect in which structured reasoning support helps clinicians re-rank rather than simply accept the model output. Preferences varied by clinical grade, suggesting opportunities to personalise responses by experience. Without ophthalmology-specific fine-tuning, AMIE matched clinician baseline and augmented clinical reasoning at the point of need, motivating multi-axis evaluation, domain adaptation, and prospective multimodal studies in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model outputs. To address these limitations, this work first proposes a Region-Aware Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (RMCoT) dataset, in which the process of producing an answer is preceded by a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T.

| **[Human-AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23476v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines, shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity, enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts, including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification, regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.</p></details> |  |

Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 12 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.
